MissionLoading:GDI_Prologue
"Recent satellite intelligence points to a suspicious activity level in the Badlands of North Carolina. InOps is concerned that the Brotherhood of Nod may be setting up shop there. Your mission is to investigate and report back as soon as possible. An abandoned GDI training facility is located nearby - use that as your base of operations in the area."
END

MissionLoading:GDI_1_1
"The Philadelphia is gone, Reykjavik has been overrun, and Nod forces are now attacking the only remaining GDI world command hub, the Pentagon. If we lose the Pentagon, GDI will be thrown into chaos, and the war will be lost. Your mission is to defend this vital installation. The first priority is restoring power to the perimeter defenses and bringing the systems back online so you can repel the main Nod attack. Then you'll need to get an engineer into the Pentagon to reestablish the command and control system links. Once the Pentagon is secure, your final objective is to counter-attack and drive Nod out of the area."
END

MissionLoading:GDI_1_2
"Nod forces have overrun all of the major GDI Air Fields in the region. Your mission is to retake Langley Air Force Base, home of the Air Combat Command. A small GDI Outpost under fire near the coast might be useful as a base of operations. We'll drop your team off nearby. Repel the attack from the base, build up a strike force, and retake our airfields. Once our Air Fields are secure and our scattered aircraft have docked and re-fueled, use them to mount a counter-offensive against all Nod forces in the area."
END

MissionLoading:GDI_1_3
"Nod has taken over our port in Hampton Roads and are using it to bring in reinforcements from across the globe. Disrupt their operations by infiltrating an elite GDI Falcon Commando into the facility. Take their radar offline by destroying their Operations Center, and once they're blind, take out their nearby Vertigo Stealth Bomber base. As soon as Nod's bombers are out of action, we'll send in a fleet of Battleships and Sniper reinforcements to help you wipe out Nod's presence in this area."
END

MissionLoading:GDI_1_4
"GDI morale sagged when Nod troops unfurled their red banners over the White House. Your mission is to turn the tide by retaking this powerful symbol. Since Nod has a staging area nearby, you'll also get a chance to wipe out a large stockpile of Nod weapons and logistics. Start with a small force to take out Nod's AA defenses, and then order an airstrike in the area. A Firehawk attack jet squadron from Langley AFB will turn Nod's parked military hardware to burning junk. The next and final objective is to clear the remaining Nod forces occupying the White House."
END

MissionLoading:GDI_2_1
"InOps flagged an irrigation plant in Casabad as a possible "Chemical Weapons" factory. A forward GDI base was established nearby in preparation for the raid, but we've since lost contact with the base and with a team of Zone Troopers sent to investigate what happened. Get in there, secure the base, and then find out what's going on in that factory."
END

MissionLoading:GDI_2_2
"Nod is using the port of Alexandria to export Nuclear and Tiberium-based weapons. Your mission is simple: Shut this operation down. Destroy the dock cranes that are loading the Nod Battleships to cripple their port operations, and then sink the ships themselves to block the docks. After that, wipe out their administration and control centers, and obliterate any military units and structures nearby. You'll have Mammoth Tanks at your disposal. Roll over them, Commander."
END

MissionLoading:GDI_2_3
"Your mission is to take out a massive Nod Nuclear Weapons Facility in Northern Cairo, the same base that was used to launch the strike on the Philadelphia. This is now the highest priority GDI target worldwide. Time is of the essence, Commander: Nod is likely to launch everything they have if they think you're getting too close."
END

MissionLoading:GDI_3_1
"GDI has a forward operating base in Croatia, but it's been cut off from supply lines and is under heavy attack by Nod forces. Their power supply is low, their Construction Yard has been destroyed, and they don't have much in the way of firepower. You need to take command of that base quickly and hold out long enough for us to send in a reinforcement convoy."
END

MissionLoading:GDI_3_2
"Recent sat-surveillance confirms a significant build-up of armored vehicles and weapons at a large Nod logistics base in Albania. The satellite images show row upon row of unmanned Raider Buggies, Scorpion Tanks, Flame Tanks, and Stealth Tanks waiting to be deployed in defense of Kane's Temple Prime in Sarajevo. Your mission is to destroy this arsenal before it is deployed to Sarajevo. You'll start with a small force to clear the outer perimeters of the base, then we'll send you Firehawk attack jets to finish the job."
END

MissionLoading:GDI_3_3
"Kane is making his last stand at Temple Prime in Sarajevo. Your mission is to take out his defending forces, destroy the surrounding compound, and disable the Ion Disruption Generators protecting the Temple complex from energy weapons. Knocking out the Ion Disruption Generators will open up options for GDI Central Command now that the Ion Cannons are nearly back online. However, be aware that Kane and his Science Ministers have been working on a Liquid Tiberium device of considerable destructive power within Temple Prime. It is imperative that you do not use the Ion Cannon on Temple Prime yourself without authorization. An Ion Cannon strike could detonate the Liquid Tiberium in the Temple and set off a chain reaction in the large Tiberium fields found throughout this Yellow Zone - the resulting blast would be massively destructive and kill millions. This is a decision that will have to be made at the highest levels of the GDI command structure."
END

MissionLoading:GDI_4_1
"The savage, unexpected attack on Munich by the invaders has taken the city's garrisoned GDI forces completely by surprise. The battle was over before it began. As the invaders ruthlessly wipe Munich from the face of the Earth, you must marshal the surviving GDI forces and fight a desperate rearguard action, holding off the enemy just long enough to allow the GDI F-T Lab Engineers to escape in armored transports. These engineers have key information about our new enemy, and must reach safety."
END

MissionLoading:GDI_4_2
"While Stuttgart is ostensibly under complete alien control, GDI has received several distorted transmissions from within the city indicating there are survivors either in hiding or pinned down by the aliens. One of these surviving units - an elite Falcon Commando - has managed to evade his attackers. You will work with this Commando to round up as many other surviving units as possible, then use the resulting force to take out the alien base dominating the city. Keep an eye out for a GDI Combat Engineering team - they are capable of reactivating both the GDI's Stuttgart base and the city's defensive grid, which would make the mission far easier."
END

MissionLoading:GDI_4_3
"Cologne is under attack by the invaders, and the city is in its last throes. However, initial recon has revealed that the GDI base in Cologne was left relatively intact by the enemy after it was abandoned by the garrison force when the alien attack started. An advance team is being dispatched to determine the size and scope of the alien presence in the city, and you'll be in command. Once you determine what you're up against, we'll send you an engineering team to get the GDI base up and running again. Protect the engineers until they can reach the base, then build up a strike force and drive the aliens from Cologne altogether. It's not too late to save the city."
END

MissionLoading:GDI_4_4
"After launching a costly but successful counterattack against the Alien invaders, the newly reconstituted GDI is finally in a position to push the Aliens out of Europe once and for all. The key is the invader's central base in Berne, Switzerland. The invaders have turned Berne into a brutal urban wasteland, a vast staging area for the invasion of Northern Europe. The alien encampment is spread across the ruined city and split into three sections: a heavily-defended central base to the northeast of the city and two adjacent support bases, one armor and one air, all ringed with what seems to be newly-seeded Tiberium fields. This is going to be a tough one. Destroy all the bases. No survivors. This is personal."
END

MissionLoading:GDI_5_1
"It's time to take the fight into the Red Zones and destroy the giant towers under construction by the invaders. Central Command isn't keen on waiting around to find out what those things are actually going to be used for...the answer is sure to be one that we won't like. Your job is to take down the tower near Rome. You will deploy into the Italian Red Zone and set up shop behind a large Tiberium chasm that is not connected to the mainland. While this provides a natural defense, you'll have to utilize Jump Jets, Call-For-Transport and air units to move across the chasm and create expansion bases. Scanners indicate several spatial anomalies in the area, and Alien entities are flooding into the region at an alarming rate. To make things worse, Nod has set up camp just northwest of the Tower's position. Given Nod's erratic behavior since the arrival of the invaders, you should be prepared for anything. The situation is crazy and getting more so by the minute."
END

MissionLoading:GDI_5_2
"Right at the heart of Italy is a unique alien structure that GDI scientists are calling the Control Node. It appears to be channeling Tiberium radiation to the alien forces all over the planet. If you can destroy the Control Node, there is a good chance that all of the alien units will cease functioning, and the invasion may be stopped dead in its tracks. Yet again, Nod forces have arrived ahead of us, and they appear to have engaged the aliens. The two sides are currently fighting over a central hill near Ground Zero and will likely use this location to stage attacks or construct super weapons. You'll have to improvise. Try capturing enemy structures for your own use. Wipe out the Nod and alien forces that get in your way, and be advised that we have intel on an unidentified alien entity en route towards the Control Node as well as a strange power surge coming from the Nod Base. Best of luck, Commander."
END

MissionLoading:NOD_Prologue
"You will be taking an elite team of Nod's best soldiers into Goddard Space Center to stage a lightning strike on the ground control systems for GDI's Anti-Missile Defense Systems. With the A-SAT systems offline, GDI assets in Earth orbit will be vulnerable to missile attacks. Your raid will start with the base Command Post: Capture it to disable their communications. That will give you a 20-minute window to destroy the A-SAT control systems."
END

MissionLoading:NOD_1_1
"An attack on the White House will simultaneously deal a terrible blow to GDI morale and serve as a distraction from more important targets. We've infiltrated a strike team into downtown DC, and they are standing by for your orders. Take command of your force and proceed with your mission."
END

MissionLoading:NOD_1_2
"Our Theatre Command Cell has ordered a coordinated attack on all GDI air bases in this region to take out GDI's air support. Your target is Andrews Air Force Base in Washington, DC. You'll take command of a strike force near the base entrance. Start by clearing any GDI troops in the surrounding area, establish an outpost, infiltrate the airbase itself, and destroy the airfields."
END

MissionLoading:NOD_1_3
"You're going to seize the largest naval base in North America and destroy one of GDI's Aircraft Carriers in the process. With the Brotherhood in control of Hampton Roads, we can start bringing in supplies and reinforcements in bulk to feed our growing offensive in this Blue Zone. The plan for this operation is a masterstroke. A few Shadow Teams have been smuggled into the port via cargo containers. Use them to take out the GDI Aircraft Carrier. Once the carrier is out of the equation, we'll send in some Venom Patrol Craft to help you take the rest of the port. One final note: we also smuggled in a Saboteur but lost contact with him a few hours ago. If you can find him, put his talents to use."
END

MissionLoading:NOD_1_4
"With GDI forces on the ropes and a flood of reinforcements pouring into our new base at Hampton Roads, the Brotherhood is now poised to take Washington, DC. You have been given the honor of striking this blow. We've set up a base on the outskirts of the city, and we're now bringing in supplies. You'll need to build an army, take out the GDI defenders, and claim this city for Nod."
END

MissionLoading:NOD_2_1
"The Brotherhood had two secret labs working on next-generation Tiberium weapons research. The main lab in North Africa was recently destroyed by GDI. The other lab is located in Brazil, in a stretch of desolate terrain called the Amazon Desert. GDI has two forward bases and a large army in the region, and are mounting attacks on the small defensive force we have deployed around the lab. You need to defend the lab against GDI forces until you can build up an army of your own, then take the fight to GDI and knock out their bases. The Lab must be kept intact at all costs."
END

MissionLoading:NOD_2_2
"The Tiberium weapon components from the Amazon Desert lab must be airlifted to Temple Prime immediately. Unfortunately, GDI is using massive artillery emplacements near the coast to block the evacuation routes to our landing zones. Your job is to take out these big guns as quickly as possible. We've established a small forward base near the first emplacement and our forces are awaiting your command. Two Vertigo Stealth Bombers have been assigned to you to help complete this mission."
END

MissionLoading:NOD_3_1
"GDI's intervention with Kane's plan continues to make life difficult for us. The transport carrying the weapon components from the backup Tiberium Weapons Lab in Brazil has been shot down in Slovenia. Nod troops from a nearby forward base recovered the components and were about to take them to safety when they were attacked by GDI. Now it's up to you. Use an elite Cobra Commando to infiltrate the area, find the crash site, and secure the weapon components. We'll fly in some reinforcements at that point. Once the components are secure, escort the transport into the forward base and restore the facility to working order. GDI has a large force nearby, so you're going to get hit hard. You will need to hold out until we can get you heavy armor that you can use to break through the GDI cordon and escort the weapon components to Temple Prime."
END

MissionLoading:NOD_3_2
"Job one is to escort the weapon components from Brazil back to Temple Prime so Kane can finish his work on the Liquid Tiberium device. This mission will be tricky because GDI has a large force in the area preparing for an assault on the Temple, and are blocking your way to secure the device. You can't take on GDI directly with the small escort force, so you'll have to maneuver around. Once the weapon transport has reached the Temple, you can focus your efforts on defending Temple Prime, building up an army, and then clearing GDI out of our most sacred site. Be advised that a Nod force from Kilian's detachment is being airlifted out of Australia despite their dire situation there. They might be headed for Sarajevo; if so, maybe they can help you out."
END

MissionLoading:NOD_4_1
"GDI is moving Nuclear Warheads from one of their bases on the edge of the Australian Red Zone. If we can intercept the convoy, destroy the escorts, and capture the warheads, then we can make the Brotherhood of Nod into a nuclear power once again. You need to recover at least one transport, but more is better. Once you've secured the warheads, the Brotherhood will dispatch a Carryall evacuation team. Be aware that the warheads are highly volatile and may explode if fired upon. Tread carefully!"
END

MissionLoading:NOD_4_2
"While the nuclear warheads have been secured, the Brotherhood still lacks the launch codes and delivery systems. GDI has what we need in the Sydney Blue Zone, currently under heavy attack by the invaders. With GDI's forces under duress, Kilian has reached out to the local GDI commander and offered to 'help' in Sydney. GDI accepted. We have committed to help GDI eliminate the invaders' base to secure the city and turn the tide of battle in the area. The primary target, however, is a GDI facility in Sydney behind the city walls, which will provide the launch codes for our nukes."
END

MissionLoading:NOD_4_3
"While the invaders have been pushed back from the western edge of the city, they have not been eliminated from the region yet. With GDI central command issuing an evacuation order for civilians, you must coordinate with GDI to carry out their exodus. Defend against the invaders' assault and protect the V35-Ox convoys moving the city's residents to safety, while at the same time protecting the Ion Cannon Control Center for ten minutes. The Ion Cannon Center will then link with the Ion Cannon itself, destroying the invaders' main base, driving them from Australia. Most important of all though is to ensure our own survival with a large-scale Tiberium harvest."
END

MissionLoading:NOD_4_5
"This is a sad day when Brother must fight Brother. Use a small force to capture the southern rebel base and then use the resources you've acquired to secure Kilian's HQ facility on Ayers Rock. Kill anyone who gets in your way, but leave Kilian alive to face Kane. Note that GDI is deploying a forward base to the east, and they are not happy at all about what happened in Sydney. Expect a large GDI assault shortly after the battle for Ayers Rock goes down as GDI moves in for the kill. Do not let GDI get to Kilian - revenge is for Kane alone."
END

MissionLoading:NOD_5_1
"Kane foresaw the arrival of the Visitors and knew a great weapon would be needed to help channel the invasion in a productive direction. Kane ordered a research facility at this Northern Italian location to produce Catalyst Missiles. This weapon is ready for use. However, the Visitors are behaving capriciously and are beginning an attack on the facility. Stop the Visitors from destroying the missile silo and then repair the facility. At that point, you'll be able to turn the tide of battle with the new weapon. Beware though, massive energy signatures seem to be coming from the alien base, so prepare for something big."
END

MissionLoading:NOD_5_2
"Kane wants to gain access to the towers being constructed by the Visitors. When they are finished, these huge structures will become indestructible interstellar gateways, opening up a path to the stars for the Brotherhood. The keys that unlock our destiny takes the form of a code embedded in a crystal lattice, somewhat like the Tacitus. Your mission is to storm a Relay Node structure in the Italian Hills to acquire one of these keys. Expect heavy resistance."
END

MissionLoading:NOD_5_3
"GDI is advancing through the Italian Red Zone more quickly than anticipated and will soon threaten every Visitor installation in Italy. We need to slow them down. The largest danger comes from a large GDI force currently routing the Alien forces on the east bank of the Tiber River. Given our small number of true believers, direct engagement is not an option. Instead, use a Cobra Commando to lead an infiltration force comprised of Shadow Teams and Saboteurs. Seize control of both GDI Construction Yards, then eliminate our most hated enemy with their own forces. Then capture both Alien Drone Platforms. Only then will Kane's plan be allowed to come to fruition. Destroy anyone or anything that gets in your way: GDI, Nod, or Visitor."
END

MissionLoading:NOD_5_4
"Your main objective here is to protect the final alien tower by annihilating the GDI forces that are assaulting it. It won't be easy. GDI has had plenty of experience knocking these things down and is attacking the alien base surrounding the final tower with relentless determination. The Phase Generators that protect the tower itself are GDI's primary target. Do not let GDI destroy them. GDI is also employing Behemoths to bombard the base from afar. Destroy the Behemoths bombarding the Visitors' base, and then destroy all remaining GDI forces."
END

MissionLoading:ALIEN_1_1
"Foreman, you've been commissioned a small army to begin attacking the major indigenous population center on the island near Continent Three. This attack will proceed in concert with other assaults on all significant population centers. The intent is to distract the indigenous population from initial Threshold construction and intimidate them to the point where they will not threaten ongoing construction efforts. Assess defensive and offensive capabilities. Eliminate all indigenous life forms you come across."
END

MissionLoading:ALIEN_1_2
"The hostile indigenous population is more advanced than expected and represents a critical threat to our forces. During diversion attacks on the major population center of Sector 2-5, Continent Three, two of our scout ships were disabled in-flight by hostile indigenous forces. These ships were carrying data nodes that are critical to Threshold construction activities. The nodes are now stranded in enemy territory. Heavy local activity is reported near the scout ships and this activity is distributed over a wide area, but energy for their forces seems to be coming from a localized source. Eliminate this source, secure the area, and clear the way for reinforcements."
END

MissionLoading:ALIEN_1_3
"Foreman, the indigenous forces' databases for their Ichor-LQ technology are being stored in two facilities in this region. These databases may hold the key to understanding how and why the signal that brought us here was prematurely generated. Capture these structures and secure them from threats by any means necessary."
END

MissionLoading:ALIEN_1_4
"Foreman, you must protect the tower at Threshold-19 until its construction is complete. Everything hangs in the balance: The success of your overall mission and the fate of the Race depend on Threshold-19 tower activation and phasing. You now have access to all our offensive and defensive capabilities. Take command of the base that is established there and keep the hostile indigenous population from destroying the tower at all costs."

IDB:000_GDI_Internal_Memos_111_GDI_Garrisoning_body
"Urban combat is a messy and dangerous business. When fighting in a city environment, field commanders should use every advantage to minimize casualties. Garrisoning civilian structures with infantry is a tactic that generates multiple rewards, including massive defensive bonuses and increased safety for the troops. Buildings can provide cover and a fire base for infantry as they shoot at targets outside without being directly exposed to enemy fire. Garrisoned buildings protect soldiers from heavy anti-personnel weapons mounted on vehicles. That being said, field commanders should be wary of enemy units that specialize in clearing garrisoned buildings, particularly those equipped with grenades and flamethrowers.\nRemember: Caught in the cross-fire while you're out in the open? Order your troops into a building."
END

IDB:000_GDI_Internal_Memos_121_GDI_Call_For_Transport_body
"Once a forward base has an Airfield, many GDI infantry and vehicles gain the ability to call for transport at almost any time. The unit can radio for transport craft from the field, and a V-35 Ox VTOL airlifter will fly to the unit's location, drop down on its thrust vectored engines, and pick up the unit. Once a destination is communicated to the Ox crew, the aircraft will ferry the airlifted unit to its destination and set it down on target. Keep in mind that units are extremely vulnerable while in the air - an Ox is a juicy target for an enemy unit that has any form of anti-air capability."

"Both GDI and the Brotherhood of Nod rely on mobility and rapid deployment for success. Armies seem to come and go all the time as the balance of power shifts, often very quickly. Given the haste with which these operations are conducted, it's not a surprise that a lot of equipment is being left behind. Our Blue Zones and Yellow Zones are becoming littered with logistics crates filled with military spares, data cores, and other equipment and supplies. Both sides use the modular G-771G container, a standard crate used by the commercial shipping industry for decades. You'll find these containers everywhere - and they should be considered targets of opportunity for our boys in the field. If your troops crack one of these containers open, odds are they'll find something useful. G-771G containers are easy to spot: just look for geometrically colored crates trimmed with diagonal stripes. Each crate sticks out like a sore thumb, and anyone can pop them open with a bit of elbow grease."

IDB:000_GDI_Internal_Memos_212_GDI_Nod_Aircraft_body
"Nod aircraft have been revolutionized considerably since the Second Tiberium War. In addition to the Banshee, Nod has since fielded the VTOL Venom scout craft (pictured below), the batwing Vertigo stealth bomber, a Carryall that can transport troops and equipment, and a high altitude long-range support bomber called the Armageddon. Venoms are lightly armored but can take on a wide variety of targets on the ground and in the air - they are even capable of engaging our Orcas in air-to-air combat. The Vertigo evades detection by most GDI sensors and only "de-cloaks" to drop its powerful bombs on target structures and units. The Nod Carryall is the counterpart to our V-35 Ox, a VTOL aircraft that can pick up and transport a wide variety of troops and equipment, but is slower and more armored. Finally, the Armageddon is seen infrequently, but when it appears on the battlefield, it usually brings bad news. Nod Armageddon aircraft are used to deliver cluster mines and several exotic air-to-ground weapons.\nSince the second Tiberium war, the Banshee has also received some upgrades; in addition to being easily capable of dispatching its Tiberium-based plasma projectiles, which burn through the thickest of armor plating, it is now able to fire them from afar, making these units even more lethal. The unit also seems to sustain more fire, in which it has been seen going toe-to-toe with our new Firehawk jets."

The Science Division's evaluation of the wreckage subsequently confirmed several large scale Tiberium weaponization efforts underway. Of most concern to InOps is evidence of significant progress towards the creation of a Liquid Tiberium device of unprecedented destructive power. The liquid form of Tiberium is a relatively new manifestation of the alien substance, and its properties are not well known. Nod's Liquid Tiberium research appears to be 5 to 10 years ahead of our Science Division.\n\nThere were also indications that Nod is working on a way to detonate Tiberium deposits and a sort of catalyst weapon for detonating existing Tiberium crystals in a sub-critical reaction.\n\nAnalysis of past Nod R&D efforts (which tend to be redundant and decentralized in nature) suggests the Nod lab in North Africa was only one of several facilities participating in the Tiberium weaponization efforts."

"Nod has fielded a new version of their classic anti-infantry weapon system known as the Flame Tank. The new model carries heavier armor, has a turret to allow for easier targeting, and uses dual flame throwers that can stay in action for long periods of time without refueling. It replaces the older "Devil's Tongue" last used in the previous war.\n\nFlame Tanks are devastating against all forms of infantry and can clear out garrisoned buildings with terrifying efficiency. InOps advises field commanders to engage Flame Tanks with armored vehicles or aircraft firing cannons or rockets. The enclosed crew compartments in armored vehicles will also protect against the inferno generated by the flame throwers."

Data analysis of alien transmissions has indicated some connection between the Tacitus recovered from Kane and the invaders.\n\nThe transmissions recorded from the invasion force seem to be patterned in a similar way to the data structure in the Tacitus. This leads us to believe that the invaders are the Scrin, or perhaps some faction thereof. It is clear upon closer examination that this invasion force demonstrates acute differences from the source of the Tacitus in dialect and physical form. Perhaps they shared some distant connection, or there was some ancient contact between their cultures?\n\nOne transmission we decoded using our most advanced decryption computers indicated alien chatter regarding another alien race they had previously encountered. We were unable to translate the word for the other alien race, but the encryption computer returned the terms brother, ascended, enemy, and Scrin. This casts some confusion on the nature of the invaders, as they share a multitude of attributes with what we have come to know as the Scrin. It seems unlikely that this is the very same alien race that brought the Tacitus to Earth, but the connection is undeniable.\n\nIf this is true, we should consider the Tacitus our most valuable military asset.

"According to sources inside the Global Defense Initiative, GDI's Security Council has voted to lower funding for the Battle Mechanized Walker Program. This severance of funds has resulted in the lowered production of several mechanized walker weapons platforms fielded by GDI, including the Wolverine, Titan, and most notably the Mammoth Walker Mark II.\n\nThe decision by the Security Council was met with praise by council members hoping to divert renewed funds to other costly high-tech projects, but protests by several GDI veterans and officers. Among the critics was Colonel Nick "Havoc" Parker, a commando and Special Operations commander, as well as an outspoken critic of the recent changes agreed upon by Security Council members.\n\n"The suits behind their desks have again decided what the soldiers on the front line get to use," Parker said. "Back in the old days, it was 'Get the job done, Havoc, no matter what it takes,' and nobody complained whenever their EVA units screamed out 'Mission Accomplished' afterwards. Now that we have the best toys on the planet and just won the [Second Tiberium] war with them, our mamas and papas on Sec-Count say we can't play with them anymore because it costs too damn much to pay for them!"\n\nWith rumors around of Nod's new heavy mechanized walker, Colonel Parker hopes that the GDI Security Council will reconsider its decision.\n\n"Nod's still out there and they aren't going away anytime soon," Havoc warned. "One of these days, we're going to need our walkers back in numbers. To go to war without them covering our [expletive] is a big mistake."\n\nColonel Parker is currently in the process of organizing a petition to retain design plans for the continued production of GDI's heavy mechanized walkers. Short of that, he hopes the manufacturing plans will be retained in GDI's War Factories and on individual GDI space stations to allow for Wolverines, Titans, and even Mammoth Walker Mk. IIs to be deployed at the request of individual base commanders.\n\nThough the council's decision has resulted in lower funding for the Battle Mechanized Walker Program, Behemoth artillery walkers are still actively being maintained and produced in large numbers as GDI's primary self-propelled artillery system."

Ion Storm Shelters are typically located between 10 and 30 meters below ground level, but no closer than 70 meters to significant deposits of underground water or Tiberium. Their construction includes 8-foot-thick, steel-reinforced concrete walls with integrated sonic emitters to prevent nearby Tiberium growth. Newer shelters include dormitories, cafeterias, medical facilities, vehicle maintenance garages, long-term power generators, and redundant sonic emitters. In high-risk areas some shelters have gained cultural significance as centers of social activity from sports to art and music events, gaining nicknames such as "Sector 7", "Old Blue" "The Hatch".\n\nIn recent years, many private organizations have developed smaller shelters for corporations and individuals at exorbitant prices. On rare occasions, these private shelters link with official GDI shelters via underground tunnels. Private citizens with shelters that link to GDI public shelters are required by law to allow access to anyone who requests aid during class C emergencies and above.\n\nNOTE: Upon arrival at an unfamiliar Blue or Yellow Zone, take special care to familiarize yourself with the locations of nearby storm shelters.

Nod first deployed this new technology on the infamous Stealth Tank. GDI eventually developed new sensors and countermeasures that neutralized Nod's stealth technology, but Nod continued to evolve the science of stealth, and the "stealth arms race" has continued unabated ever since.\n\nNod's new stealth technology is allowing a number of their vehicles and units to successfully evade detection by most current-gen GDI sensors. As a result, Nod stealth units are proving brutally effective against our forces in the field. Nod has clearly leapfrogged GDI in stealth technology and countermeasures.\n\nGDI field commanders should be aware that the latest G-Tech sensors are required for detection of Nod stealth units. Unfortunately, the newest sensors are not widely deployed. Only Falcon hovercraft scout vehicles, Outposts, and base defenses come standard with the latest stealth detecting technology. Other units like Zone Troopers, Zone Raiders, or Commandoes must be upgraded with Scanner Packs, and Orca aircraft can be equipped with Sensor Pods or use a recharging pulse scan to detect nearby hidden enemies.\n\nNote that units equipped with stealth technology can sustain the stealth field while inactive or moving, but once any offensive action is taken, the field will break down and the unit will become visible.

A hub can repair and even rebuild the three turrets that are slaved to it. To take out one of these new base defenses, destroy the hub. That's the only way to make sure the structure is neutralized for good. Also, commanders should note that these new defenses are being deployed in three distinct flavors: Anti-vehicle, anti-infantry, and anti-aircraft.

"Sniper Teams can take down enemy infantry with deadly precision. They employ personal stealth generators so they can't be seen or detected normally. A Sniper Team allows you to designate targets for any Behemoth artillery unit for miles around. The Behemoth crew will be able to see and target enemy units and structures anywhere near active Sniper Teams in the environment."
END

IDB:003_GDI_Weaponry_123_GDI_ComPost_Intro_body
"GDI forward bases act as the hubs for GDI operations in all Zones and weather conditions. The heart of any GDI forward base is the Command Post. From this structure, field commanders can maintain contact with regional GDI resources and centralize intelligence for rapid response. High-powered radar and communications equipment allow officers real-time feedback from units in the field, but note that this gear will draw significant power from your base grid."
END

IDB:003_GDI_Weaponry_124_GDI_Airfield_Intro_body
"Air assets are often dedicated to support a particular ground force. The modular GDI Airfield can be established to maintain up to four combat aircraft indefinitely. The facility is capable of refueling, repairing, and rearming Orca ground attack aircraft, but can also sustain Firehawk VTOL attack jets with the addition of advanced technical equipment. Airfields each directly control a small element of aircraft, so without an Airfield, these craft may suffer guidance failure and the inability to maintain extended operations, considering global ion storm interference."
END

IDB:003_GDI_Weaponry_125_GDI_Orca_Intro_body
"The highly maneuverable and light-weight Orca aerial weapons platform has supported GDI ground campaigns for decades. The Mk IV version currently deployed with GDI forces worldwide is an all-new, state-of-the-art aircraft. With VTOL capability that allows it to operate from small pads, a high cruising speed, long range, and the ability to hover for extended periods, the Mk IV Orca is a truly versatile weapon system. Its air-to-ground missiles can strike a wide variety of targets, including enemy vehicles and structures. The Mk IV can also be equipped with a sensor array capable of detecting even the most advanced Nod stealth units. Field commanders should note that Orcas are not capable of engaging targets in the air and should be escorted by Firehawk attack jets carrying air-to-air missiles when operating in areas where Nod commands air superiority."
END

IDB:003_GDI_Weaponry_132_GDI_Commando_Intro_body
"The deadliest weapon in the GDI arsenal isn't a tank or an aircraft - it's a human being. GDI's elite Commando is truly an "army of one", backed by 50 years of tradition and trained in a grueling program that has a 22% fatality rate and a 97% drop-out rate for the survivors (even after starting with the very best of the best in all branches of service). Commandos are equipped with special battle armor, solid fuel jump jets, a high fire-rate machine gun, and det-packs that can take down an entire building with an exotic new explosive. GDI weapons labs equip Commandos with the prototypes of GDI's next-gen weapons, so nobody else on the battlefield has the toys these boys have. The most elite Commandos are also trained to use their det-packs on vehicles and the legs of large walkers, one of the reasons that GDI retired many of the bipedal walkers that were a mainstay in the second Tiberium War (given that this new vulnerability seemed like it could be exploited by Nod elite units as well)."
END

IDB:003_GDI_Weaponry_142_GDI_Predator_Tank_Intro_body
"Equipped with a 125mm cannon, this 65-ton tank packs an armor-piercing punch against any vehicle or structure. It's also fast and quite maneuverable for a large armored vehicle. Devastating in numbers, Predator tanks can rip through enemy encampments quickly, as well as crush infantry under their tracks. They have excellent armor, but are vulnerable to armor-piercing rocket and cannon attacks."
END

IDB:003_GDI_Weaponry_143_GDI_Base_Defenses_Intro_body
"GDI has 3 basic base defenses with which to ward off enemy attacks: The Watchtower, the Guardian Cannon, and the Missile Battery.\n\nThe Watchtower stands 30ft tall with twin 20mm machine guns mounted atop it. Equipped with an IR spotlight and next-gen sensor to detect stealthed units, this anti-infantry defense tears enemy infantry to shreds. Programmed to attack any ground unit that comes within its range, the Watchtower is also able to distinguish between infantry and tanks and will prioritize infantry over tanks to maximize the lethality of its anti-personnel ammunition.\n\nThe Guardian Cannon is equipped with a 105mm gun capable of ripping through the heavy armor of tanks. The Guardian is an anti-vehicle weapon and is not as effective against infantry.\n\nThe Missile Battery is unable to defend itself against ground units, but fires laser-guided missiles at air targets. Missile Batteries are very effective against any form of aircraft, especially with their deadly accurate fire control system and a staggering fire rate."
END

IDB:003_GDI_Weaponry_144_GDI_Crane_body
"If a forward base needs to go up fast, consider building a Crane to open up a second production queue at the Construction Yard. The nano-assemblers, computers, and control units will be able to work on two base structures simultaneously, albeit unable to build certain advanced structures, as cranes lack the construction power of the Construction Yard."
END

IDB:003_GDI_Weaponry_216_GDI_Zone_Trooper_Intro_body
"GDI Zone Troopers are elite heavy infantry with exceptional mobility, armor, and enough firepower to take out enemy light and heavy armor. Equipped with power armor, rail guns, and jump jets that can boost them over obstacles or across rivers, Zone Troopers do the heavy lifting for the GDI Infantry."
END

IDB:003_GDI_Weaponry_221_War_Factory_Repair_Drones_body
"Everyone knows that War Factories build vehicles. But did you know that a War Factory can also perform repairs? War Factories have been upgraded with autonomous repair drones that can perform even the most complex repairs to severely damaged vehicles in a very short period of time. How does it work? Just get close. Vehicle crews should bring their vehicles back to the base War Factory if their vehicles are damaged, and the drones will begin repair operations once the vehicles are in proximity to the factory structure."
END

IDB:003_GDI_Weaponry_222_Surveyor_Base_Expansion_body
"Some forward base Construction Yards can build Surveyor vehicles (found under the Support Structure Tab of the base control interface), which can deploy into a small Outpost. Surveyors can be given the command to deploy on any terrain where base structures can be built. Once an Expansion Base is established, the Construction Yard in the main base can be used to build any structure nearby, including Refineries, War Factories, base defenses, and whatever else might be useful. The Surveyor and the Outpost it creates are superb tools for claiming territory near strategic targets like remote Tiberium fields (so refineries can be built nearby, saving harvesters from a long commute through possible enemy-controlled terrain). In addition, for added utility, Outposts have been outfitted with an IR spotlight to detect nearby enemy stealthed units trying to sabotage base expansions, as well as repair drones to support damaged vehicles."
END

IDB:003_GDI_Weaponry_331_Rig_Deployment_body
"GDI field commanders in some forward bases have access to one of the most unique power projection systems in the world: The Rig. The Rig is a vehicle that is designed to roll deep into enemy territory and quickly deploy into a heavily armed Battle Base structure. Equipped with Guardian cannons, machine guns, and a missile launcher, the Battle Base is capable of engaging all types of enemy units. As a bonus, Rigs carry a complement of auto-drones for making field repairs to GDI vehicles. The Rig/Battle Base combination is ideal for claiming and holding terrain, enabling GDI field commanders to employ a classic "clear and hold" strategy for securing Tiberium fields or gradually taking over an objective area."
END

IDB:003_GDI_Weaponry_332_Firehawk_Jets_body
"The Firehawk is a fast and highly maneuverable VTOL attack jet that can carry air-to-ground or air-to-air missiles. Field commanders can make their load-out choices while the Firehawk is on the pad at an airfield. Firehawks can also be equipped with special rocket boosters that allow the aircraft to punch into the stratosphere and go near-orbital to hop over enemy air defenses. Note that Firehawks are vulnerable to AA fire in the actual target zone during the re-entry after the boost phase."

"...As of 2043, GDI has closed over 60% of its military bases around the world, including installations in North Carolina, Brazil, and Eastern Europe. The most recent cutbacks are due to a decrease in Nod activity - with Kane dead, the Brotherhood seems to be splintering apart..."
END

IDB:005_GDI_Background_012_Tiberium_Primer_body
"Tiberium is a scientific curiosity, a vastly powerful resource, an unprecedented environmental cataclysm, a catalyst for war, and much more. It's like nothing we've ever seen before, and it is constantly transforming itself.\n\nWe are almost certain Tiberium is extraterrestrial in origin; it is not man-made and there is no evidence of the substance on Earth before its first appearance half a century ago. Early forms of Tiberium were almost organic, sprouting out of the ground in what seemed to be plant-like pods, leaching minerals out of the earth, and emitting clouds of toxic gas. Over time, Tiberium showed it could evolve and change.\n\nBy 2047, most Tiberium on Earth has manifested in what we know as its most common form: A self-replicating proton lattice that turns any matter it touches into more of itself, giving off powerful radiation in the process. It can change anything it comes into contact with into more Tiberium.\n\nIs Tiberium terraforming the Earth into a planet suitable for alien life? Is it a weapon? Is it a creature of some kind? Perhaps some form of consciousness resides in the crystal lattices, a quantum crystalline brain that grows ever smarter as it grows and grows. There are many theories about what Tiberium actually is...and why it is here. Ultimately, its origin and its purpose - if it has one - are still a mystery.\n\nGDI has not given up on trying to contain the spread of Tiberium. With Tiberium infestation reaching critical levels and new, more sinister variants of the substance turning up, things started to look pretty grim for planet Earth in the middle of the 21st century. However, GDI has found a vulnerability in the green crystal that they have begun to exploit. GDI engineers have found the resonant frequency for Tiberium...and they have created sonic resonators that are capable of breaking up Tiberium crystals.\n\nA high-level scientific explanation of the alien substance is included here for students, engineers, and scientists: The most recent form of Tiberium is a dense "dynamic proton lattice" held together by exotic heavy particles. When Tiberium comes into contact with other matter, the heavy particles randomly collide with the nuclei of the target matter, smashing it to pieces (in the case of smaller nuclei) or incrementally knocking off protons or neutrons (in the case of heavier nuclei). Tiberium captures a fraction of the protons that are ejected during this collision process and incorporates them into its own structure, thus transmuting matter into more Tiberium. Whenever one of the heavy particles - a muon or tauon - collides with an atomic nucleus, fission occurs, which results in the production of alpha, beta, and gamma radiation as well as other forms of electromagnetic radiation (like infra-red). During the transmutation process, nuclei that Tiberium has come into contact with may be changed into nuclei with different (usually fewer) numbers of protons or neutrons."

IDB:005_GDI_Background_114_About_The_Brotherhood_body
"GDI views Nod as a dangerous, virulent, and inexplicably self-sustaining terrorist group obsessed with accelerating the worst ecological catastrophe in history, led by a charismatic and brilliant sociopath named Kane. The Brotherhood sees itself quite differently. Nod believes that it is the agent of change for a world in the throes of transition to a new order, the representative of the poor and the oppressed, and a foil to the previously unchecked power of GDI.\n\nNod has the people, resources, organization, and raw military power necessary to stand against GDI and wage war on a global scale. Yet the Brotherhood of Nod isn't a country; it's a strange new hybrid organization that has the combined characteristics of a religious movement, a multinational corporation, and a nation-state. Given the awesome demands of modern warfare, with its terrible cost and vast scale, Nod's ability to go toe-to-toe with GDI is astonishing.\n\nNod can recruit thousands of new members every month from the desperate populations of the borderlands. Their political, military, and logistical operations are decentralized and buried deep inside crumbling cities, towns, and outposts in the decaying Yellow Zones. A vast and sophisticated infrastructure is disguised from GDI, and Nod has perfected the art of moving military assets and forces quickly over long distances without detection, even by satellite or drone aircraft with the latest generation sensors.\n\nNod's core organization is very sophisticated and high-tech, but they also have a large guerrilla force composed of hastily trained and minimally equipped recruits from the Yellow Zones. Nod's field forces are an interesting mix of low tech "militia" troops and smaller numbers of highly trained, elite soldiers equipped with state of the art communications gear and the most advanced weapon systems available.\n\nNod's military assets are experimental and exotic in both appearance and function, but the durability of their units is suspect. Nod engineers are not afraid to risk human life and will often sacrifice safety and protection for increased abilities and speed. Their high-end military hardware runs on Tiberium and tends to be fast but vulnerable, lethal but unstable. Non-offensive weapons deployed on vehicles range from rockets, machine guns, flame throwers, lasers, and nuclear weapons. They also have several Tiberium-based weapons."

IDB:005_GDI_Background_115_About_The_GDI_body
"The Global Defense Initiative began as a secret military alliance of advanced nations under the United Nations umbrella. GDI's mission: To contain Tiberium, reverse its spread, and fight the sinister Brotherhood of Nod.\n\nOver time, power and sovereignty have been gradually ceded to GDI, and the national identities of the participating countries have faded. In 2047, that process has reached its final stages: While there are still technically individual Member Nations, the reality is that GDI has become a unified political and military super-state.\n\nGDI controls the only areas of the Earth that have not been significantly compromised by Tiberium infestation. The crystalline alien substance is slowly consuming the rest of the planet, causing an environmental cataclysm that has made 30% of the Earth uninhabitable and another 50% of the Earth's surface exceedingly unfriendly to civilization. GDI's home territories are known as "Blue Zones" since they are mostly clear of Tiberium and have been relatively untouched by war (in contrast to the ecologically ravaged and war-torn "Yellow Zones" and the Tiberium infested hellscapes designated as "Red Zones").\n\nThe clash between GDI and Nod has escalated into full world wars twice before - the First Tiberium War (TWI) erupted when both powers were in their formative states and that terrible war was followed by another worldwide Firestorm several years later."

"What happens if you're exposed to Tiberium? Nothing good. If you come into direct contact with Tiberium, the green matter will start to fuse with your skin within about 20 seconds. You'll feel an intense burning sensation, similar to touching a hot pan or spilling acid on your skin. A full-blown infection will manifest if you aren't treated immediately. Your flesh will begin to take on a glassy-greenish appearance as it begins to crystallize; eventually, your internal organs will shut down as Tiberium extends rigid crystalline runners throughout your body. If you breathe in the crystal, then it will become embedded in your lungs. You'll lose the ability to process oxygen as your lung tissue crystallizes. Eventually, you'll start coughing up blood and will hemorrhage to death.\n\nIn some cases - and for unknown reasons - Tiberium infection will trigger cellular mutation. It's not cancer in that the mutations seem strangely directed; they don't kill you, but your body will begin to transform. The mechanism for this mutation is not well understood."
END

IDB:005_GDI_Background_013_Zones_body
"Tiberium infestation has rendered 30% of the planet totally uninhabitable. Large swaths of the Earth's surface have been designated as "Red Zones" - desolate areas, swept by ion storms, and contaminated by vast amounts of Tiberium. Venturing into, over, or even near these wastelands can be extremely dangerous.\n\nBeyond the Red Zones, Tiberium contamination has caused varying levels of environmental damage in another 50% of the Earth's populated areas. In the ecologically compromised and war-torn Yellow Zones, Tiberium fields are common - growing in the middle of cities, on farmland, and throughout the environment. Tiberium-related climate change has caused an endless cycle of droughts, floods, and severe weather of all types, including spectacular Category 6 hurricanes, tornadoes with wind speeds of 500 miles per hour, and exceedingly violent thunderstorms. Especially destructive Ion Storms occasionally rage out of the Red Zones to wreak havoc on cities and towns in the borderlands.\n\nOnly 20% of the Earth's surface is in relatively pristine condition. Blue Zones suffer from minimal Tiberium infestation and have been relatively untouched by war. The populations of the Blue Zones live in relative comfort, going about their lives in high-tech futuristic cities that sit in forested valleys or nestle in pastoral farmland."
END

IDB:005_GDI_Background_222_Yellow_Zone_Life_body
"Tiberium contamination affects Yellow Zones directly and indirectly. Climate change, melting glacial ice, extreme weather, Tiberium field growth, and decades of war have caused social collapse in several Yellow Zones. Many cities in the most afflicted areas are run by warlords and criminal organizations or have degenerated into anarchy, or they have fallen under the thrall of the sinister Brotherhood of Nod.\n\nExistence in the worst-off Yellow Zones is not pleasant at all. Your home is likely to be in a decaying building with no running water. Power comes on for a few hours a day at erratic times. Food is scarce. Doctors are rare. On a few occasions, food aid or medical care will be provided by humanitarian workers visiting from the pristine and high-tech Blue Zones.\n\nA subsistence living is just the start. Tiberium contamination is a fact of life, and thousands die every year from inhaling microscopic crystals that are carried in smog, clouds of dust, and other airborne particulates. Tiberium may even fall out of the sky suspended in raindrops if the clouds overhead have passed through a Red Zone during or after an Ion Storm. Because of the drought conditions in many Yellow Zones, rain showers are often greeted by the local populations with an odd mix of fear, dread, and joy.\n\nIn the harsh reality of a Yellow Zone, Tiberium is not the only threat. If Tiberium doesn't get you, then you are likely to fall victim to a violent crime, get caught in the crossfire between warlords clashing over turf, or become a collateral damage statistic in the global war between the armies of the Global Defense Initiative and the Brotherhood of Nod."

IDB:005_GDI_Background_241_GDI_Nuclear_Weapons_body
"GDI still possesses a nuclear arsenal stored at key locations around the world (including a large nuke base in the desolate outback of Australia, heavily defended silos in North American Yellow Zones, and installations in other remote areas). GDI leaders long ago made a vow not to ever use nuclear weapons, no matter how bad the situation got, and kept that vow even as Nod acquired its own nuclear capability. GDI's nukes are few in number but are stored with delivery systems (including ICBMs) and kept at top operational readiness just in case GDI leaders ever change their minds. The most difficult test of GDI nuclear policy came in the early days of TW3, right after the strike on the Philadelphia, but even then, it's questionable how effective nukes would have been in stemming the Nod tide, given that Nod's forces were highly decentralized and Nod troops were staging operations deep in GDI Blue Zones. Some view GDI's pledge not to use nukes as a cynical one, given that they deployed a new precision weapon of mass destruction - the Ion Cannon - right at the time they made their vow."

The ground is a blasted and barren plateau of rock laced with veins of Tiberium that shine through with a malevolent green radiance. On the horizon are massive formations of pure Tiberium that have welled up through the surrounding earth. These frozen crystalline glaciers cast a sickly emerald glow on the surrounding terrain. Tilt your head and you'll contemplate a cloudy, tortured sky alive with twisting patterns of shimmering light and flickers of lightning. If you wait long enough, you'll see an Ion Storm begin to form, the lightning overhead intensifying until the entire environment is lit with rapid strobing flashes. Eventually, the vast and terrible energy overhead will begin arcing to the ground around you in a terrifying display of destructive force. These fireworks are accompanied by a howling, toxic whirlwind that scours the deserted ground and drives shards of Tiberium before it at insane speeds.\n\nRed Zones are like the surface of an alien world. Scientists have speculated that Tiberium is actually a terraforming agent for an alien civilization, slowly transforming our world into an environment suitable for beings that have evolved on a different planet. No definitive conclusions have been reached."

The abundance of Tiberium fields, the toxic radiation, the intimidating terrain (including chasms and cliffs), the terrible weather, and the huge Tiberium glaciers all contribute to make these hellscapes a nightmare for field commanders. On the bright side, considering our resources and mobility, we have found that Red Zone conditions don't completely jeopardize our fighting ability. The following operational techniques are found to be the most effective in Red Zone combat actions:\n\n- Jump Jets: our Commandos, Zone Troopers, and Zone Raiders make the best use of GDI technology by simply jumping across the wide swathes of hostile terrain.\n\n- Calling For Transport: the ground terrain poses serious challenges that can be circumvented by bringing in a V-35 Ox to move units around.\n\n- Expanding Ground Control: ground control can sometimes expand build radius beyond the length of a chasm, allowing units to be produced on the other side. In addition, transporting Surveyors across chasms can allow for base construction on the other side."
