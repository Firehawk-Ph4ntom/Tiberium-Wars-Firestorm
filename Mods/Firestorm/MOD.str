"Connection Opened\n\nReceived Transmission:\n\nSource: Sirius 57 Alpha\n\nPriority: Vermillion\n\nScramble Index: Foxtrot-Oscar-8\n\nINTEL SECTION 93 REPORT\n\nShadow team Alpha-22 deployed to enemy theatre of operations in Area 11, Vanguard Sector, coordinates Golf-9-Kilo-5. Mission: Collect radiological and full spectrum data on Visitor structure Type 8 with intent to discern primary functional capability. Arrived 0200 hours undetected, 320 meters from target. Deployed receptors and gathered data for ~19 hours before "Seeker" patrols ambushed the team. Six of eight team members eliminated in escape. One subsequently died of injuries sustained during extraction.\n\nInitial analysis of gathered data shows that Type 8 structure acts as a "Gravity Stabilizer" to compensate for intense gravitic fields generated by planetary bodies. This evidently allows alien spacecraft to make short-range teleportation jumps into the Earth's magnetic and gravitic field with maximum precision. Gravity Stabilizers typically appear only in well secured areas where alien operations are highly focused.\n\nVisitor craft observed utilizing the Gravity Stabilizer include the units designated as "Stormrider", "Devastator Warship", "Planetary Assault Carrier", and "Conqueror Battleship". These craft appear to be entering the area of operations using the Gravity Stabilizer before heading to objectives in the surrounding regions.\n\nRecommendation: Prioritize destruction of Gravity Stabilizer structures in combat zones. In neutral zones disable via reactor sabotage in order to delay deployment of major enemy combat units.\n\nNote: Structure Type 8 now designated as Gravity Stabilizer.\n\nConnection Closed"

Through our research and our faith, we have affirmed that Tiberium is the ultimate gift to mankind. It is the key to the future.\n\nOur movement grew rapidly as Tiberium spread across the Earth.

Even better, the critical personnel and equipment are concentrated in a single facility in the northeastern Blue Zone. A well-planned surprise strike on Goddard Space Center could take all of GDI's Ion Cannons and their entire A-SAT system offline, giving the Brotherhood days and possibly weeks to conduct combat operations across the planet unhindered by space-based weapons and prying eyes.\n\nAs a bonus, the primary GDI world command hub is based on board the space station Philadelphia.

Take their radar offline by destroying the Nod Operations Center, and once they're blind, take out their nearby stealth bomber base. As soon as Nod's bombers are out of action, we'll send in a fleet of Battleships and Sniper reinforcements to help you wipe out Nod's presence in this area."

"GDI morale sagged when Nod troops unfurled their red banners over the White House. Your mission is to turn the tide by retaking this powerful symbol. Since Nod has a staging area nearby, you'll also get a chance to wipe out a large stockpile of high-end Nod weapons and logistics. Start with a small force to take out Nod's air defenses, and then order an airstrike in the area. A Firehawk squadron from Langley AFB will turn Nod's parked military hardware to burning junk. The next and final objective is to clear the remaining Nod forces occupying the White House."

Your mission is to take out his defending forces, destroy the surrounding compound, and disable the Ion Disruption Generators protecting the temple complex from energy weapons. Knocking out the Disruption Generators will open up options for GDI Central Command now that the Ion Cannons are nearly back online. However, be aware that Kane and his Science Ministers have been working on a Liquid Tiberium device of considerable destructive power within Temple Prime. It is imperative that you do not use the Ion Cannon on Temple Prime yourself without authorization. An Ion Cannon strike could detonate the Liquid Tiberium in the Temple and set off a chain reaction in the large Tiberium fields found throughout this Yellow Zone - the resulting blast would be massively destructive and kill millions. This is a decision that will have to be made at the highest levels of the GDI command structure."

One of these surviving units - an elite Commando - has managed to evade his attackers. You will work with this Commando to round up as many other surviving units as possible, then use the resulting force to take out the alien base dominating the city. Keep an eye out for a GDI combat engineering team - they are capable of reactivating both GDI's Stuttgart base and the city's defensive grid, which would make the mission far easier."

However, initial recon has revealed that the GDI base in Cologne was left relatively intact by the enemy after it was abandoned by the garrison force when the alien attack started. An advance team is being dispatched to determine the size and scope of the alien presence in the city and you'll be in command. Once you determine what you're up against, we'll send you an engineering team to get the GDI base up and running again.

The key is the invader's central base in Berne, Switzerland. The invaders have turned Berne into a brutal urban wasteland, a vast staging area for the invasion of Northern Europe. The alien encampment is spread across the ruined city and split into three sections: a heavily-defended central base to the northeast of the city and two adjacent support bases, one armor and one air, all ringed with what seems to be newly-seeded Tiberium fields. This is going to be a tough one. Destroy all the bases. No survivors. This is personal."

Central Command isn't keen on waiting around to find out what those things are actually going to be used for...the answer is sure to be one that we won't like. Your job is to take down the tower near Rome. You will deploy into the Italian Red Zone and set up shop behind a large Tiberium chasm that is not connected to the main landmass. While this provides a natural defense, you'll have to utilize jump jets, call-for-transport and aerial units to move across the chasm and create expansion bases. Scanners indicate several spatial anomalies in the area and Alien entities are flooding into the region at an alarming rate. To make things worse, Nod has set up camp just northwest of the Tower's position. Given Nod's erratic behavior since the arrival of the invaders, you should be prepared for anything. The situation is crazy and getting more so by the minute."

"Right at the heart of Italy is a unique alien structure that GDI scientists are calling the Control Node. It appears to be channeling Tiberium radiation to the alien forces all over the planet. If you can destroy the Control Node, there is a good chance that all of the alien units will cease functioning and the invasion may be stopped dead in its tracks. Yet again, Nod forces have arrived ahead of us and they appear to have engaged the aliens. The two sides are currently fighting over a central hill near Ground Zero and will likely use this location to stage attacks or construct super weapons. You'll have to improvise. Try capturing enemy structures for your own use. Wipe out the Nod and alien forces that get in your way, and be advised that we have intel on an unidentified alien entity en-route towards the Control Node. Best of luck, Commander."

Nod troops from a nearby forward base recovered the components and were about to take them to safety when they were attacked by GDI. Now it's up to you. Use an elite Commando to infiltrate the area, find the crash site, and secure the weapon components. We'll fly in some reinforcements at that point. Once the components are secure, escort the transport into the forward base and restore the facility to working order. GDI has a large force nearby, so you're going to get hit hard.

This mission will be tricky because GDI has a large force in the area preparing for an assault on the temple, and are blocking your way to secure the device. You can't take on GDI directly with the small escort force, so you'll have to maneuver around. Once the weapon transport has reached the temple, you can focus your efforts on defending Temple Prime, building up an army, and then clearing GDI out of our most sacred site.

"Urban combat is a messy and dangerous business. When fighting in a city environment, field commanders should use every advantage to minimize casualties. Garrisoning civilian structures with infantry is a tactic that generates multiple rewards, including massive defensive bonuses and increased safety for the troops. Buildings can provide cover and a fire base for infantry as they shoot at targets outside without being directly exposed to enemy fire. Garrisoned buildings protect soldiers from heavy anti-personnel weapons mounted on vehicles. That being said, field commanders should be wary of enemy units that specialize in clearing garrisoned buildings, particularly those equipped with grenades and flamethrowers.\nRemember: Caught in the cross-fire while you're out in the open?

Our Blue Zones and Yellow Zones are becoming littered with logistics crates filled with military spares, data cores, and other equipment and supplies. Both sides use the modular G-771G container, a standard crate used by the commercial shipping industry for decades. You'll find these containers everywhere - and they should be considered targets of opportunity for our boys in the field. If your troops crack one of these containers open, odds are they'll find something useful. G-771G containers are easy to spot: just look for geometric colored crates trimmed with diagonal stripes.

"Nod aircraft have been revolutionized considerably since the Second Tiberium War. In addition to the Banshee, Nod has since fielded the VTOL Venom scout craft (pictured below), the batwing Vertigo stealth bomber, a Carryall that can transport troops and equipment, and a high altitude long-range support bomber called the Armageddon. Venoms are lightly armored but can take on a wide variety of targets on the ground and in the air - they are even capable of engaging our Orcas in air-to-air combat. The Vertigo evades detection by most GDI sensors and only "de-cloaks" to drop its powerful bombs on target structures and units. The Nod Carryall is the counterpart to our V-35 Ox, a VTOL aircraft that can pick up and transport a wide variety of troops and equipment but is slower and more armored. Finally, the Armageddon is seen infrequently but when it appears on the battlefield, it usually brings bad news. Nod Armageddon aircraft are used to deliver cluster mines and several exotic air-to-ground weapons.\nSince the second Tiberium war, the Banshee has also recieved some upgrades; in addition of being easily capable of dispatching its Tiberium-based plasma projectiles which burn through the thickest of armor plating, it is now able to fire them from afar, making these units even more lethal.

The liquid form of Tiberium is a relatively new manifestation of the alien substance and its properties are not well known. Nod's Liquid Tiberium research appears to be 5 to 10 years ahead of our Science Division.\n\nThere were also indications that Nod is working on a way to detonate Tiberium deposits and a sort of catalyst weapon for detonating existing Tiberium crystals in a sub-critical reaction.\n\nAnalysis of past Nod R&D efforts (which tend to be redundant and decentralized in nature) suggests the Nod lab in North Africa was only one of several facilities participating in the Tiberium weaponization efforts."

This leads us to believe that the invaders are the Scrin, or perhaps some faction thereof. It is clear upon closer examination that this invasion force demonstrates acute differences from the source of the Tacitus in dialect and physical form. Perhaps they shared some distant connection, or there was some ancient contact between their cultures?\n\nOne transmission we decoded using our most advanced decryption computers indicated alien chatter regarding another alien race they had previously encountered. We were unable to translate the word for the other alien race, but the encryption computer returned the terms brother, ascended, enemy, and Scrin. This casts some confusion on the nature of the invaders, as they share a multitude of attributes with what we have come to know as the Scrin. It seems unlikely that this is the very same alien race that brought the Tacitus to Earth, but the connection is undeniable.\n\nIf this is true, we should consider the Tacitus our most valuable military asset. We must somehow find a way to unlock its secrets."

"Front line forces in Europe have managed to capture and reactivate an alien Tripod. A Commando in direct contact with the enemy disabled the Tripod by planting a high explosive charge on the legs of the walker. GDI forces then immediately moved in and established a perimeter around the immobilized alien war machine. Once the area was secure, a combat engineer was able to gain access to the walker, repair the damaged leg, and reactivate the onboard systems. Early reports indicate that the engineer was able to communicate in a rudimentary fashion with the walker's control entity by utilizing decryption programs similar to those found in the Tacitus, the alien artifact decoded by GDI several decades ago."

The Alien Mastermind, an enemy commando of sorts, was able to teleport forces across the gap and jeopardize our entire operation. The aliens were able to keep the pressure on with a minimal numbers of units and crafty use of their Stasis Chamber and Mastermind. We believe the Mastermind has more powers than just teleporting units, but did not observe any additional capabilities directly.\n\nIf Masterminds are deployed to the battlefield, field commanders should make it a priority to eliminate them ASAP. The amount of mobility the Masterminds afford the alien invaders makes them a very high value target.

In fact, this one Control Node could easily supply a uniform bath of radiation to alien units as far away as Earth's moon. What is this radiation and why is it needed? Is it for power? Communications? Synchronization? Coordination and control? Does it provide something essential for the alien machines or the organic matter inside? We don't know the answers to any of these questions, but we do believe that the Control Node is the key vulnerability for the aliens. Take out the Control Node and there is a good chance the whole alien force will collapse like dominos."

"According to sources inside the Global Defense Initiative, GDI's Security Council has voted to lower funding for the Battle Mechanized Walker Program. This severance of funds has resulted in the lowered production of several mechanized walker weapons platforms fielded by GDI, including the Wolverine, Titan, and most notably the Mammoth Walker Mark II.\n\nThe decision by the Security Council was met with praise by council members hoping to divert renewed funds to other costly high-tech projects, but protest by several GDI veterans and officers. Among the critics was Colonel Nick "Havoc" Parker, a commando and Special Operations commander, as well as an outspoken critic of the recent changes agreed upon by Security Council members.\n\n"The suits behind their desks have again decided what the soldiers on the front line get to use" Parker said. "Back in the old days, it was 'Get the job done Havoc, no matter what it takes' and nobody complained whenever their EVA units screamed out 'Mission Accomplished' afterwards. Now that we have the best toys on the planet and just won the [Second Tiberium] war with them, our mamas and papas on Sec-Count say we can't play with them anymore because it costs too damn much to pay for them!"\n\nWith rumors around of Nod's new heavy mechanized walker, Colonel Parker hopes that the GDI Security Council will reconsider its decision.\n\n"Nod's still out there and they aren't going away anytime soon" Havoc warned. "One of these days, we're going to need our walkers back in numbers. To go to war without them covering our [expletive] is a big mistake."\n\nColonel Parker is currently in the process of organizing a petition to retain design plans for continued production of GDI's mechanized walkers. Short of that, he hopes the manufacturing plans will be retained in GDI's War Factories and on individual GDI space stations so as to allow for Wolverines, Titans, and even Mammoth Walker Mk. IIs to be deployed at the request of individual base commanders.\n\nThough the council's decision has went through to lower funding for the Battle Mechanized Walker Program, Behemoth artillery walkers are still actively being maintained and produced in large numbers as GDI's primary self-propelled artillery system."

"GDI Storm Shelters are located throughout all Blue Zones and in select Yellow Zone operational areas. They are generally found in close proximity to population centers and government installations. The earliest shelters were built after Ion Storms decimated population centers, including an incident resulting in the death of the famed Dr. Mobius and his top staff. Ion Storm Shelters are typically located between 10 and 30 meters below ground level, but no closer than 70 meters to significant deposits of underground water or Tiberium. Their construction includes 8 foot thick, steel-reinforced concrete walls with integrated sonic emitters to prevent nearby Tiberium growth. Newer shelters include dormitories, cafeterias, medical facilities, vehicle maintenance garages, long-term power generators and redundant sonic emitters. In high-risk areas some shelters have gained cultural significance as centers of social activity from sports to art and music events, gaining nicknames such as "Sector 7", "Old Blue" "The Hatch".\n\nIn recent years, many private organizations have developed smaller shelters for corporations and individuals at exorbitant prices. On rare occasions, these private shelters link with official GDI shelters via underground tunnels. Private citizens with shelters that link to GDI public shelters are required by law to allow access to anyone who requests aid during class C emergencies and above.\n\nNOTE: Upon arrival at an unfamiliar Blue or Yellow Zone, take special care to familiarize yourself with the locations of nearby storm shelters. They can also be easily identified by the international Ion Storm Shelter symbol."

The question remains, however, what was the purpose of the tower?\n\nAlien towers have been constructed in nineteen Red Zones. Their precise purpose is unknown but their location in the heart of the Tiberium infested hellscapes we call Red Zones indicates that they are somehow connected to the crystalline substance. The alien retreat to the towers suggests a serious military realignment or a change of course by the invaders.\n\nWhile GDI scientists have been pushing to get a close-up analysis of the towers, military commanders have insisted their quick destruction is the primary concern.

"Nod's Next-gen Stealth Technology Poses a Serious Threat\n\nIn the first Tiberium war, Nod scientists developed a cloaking device that could be mounted on a vehicle, a stealth generator that created an energy field that could literally bend light around a particular object, rendering it invisible to the eye and to radar. Nod first deployed this new technology on the infamous Stealth Tank. GDI eventually developed new sensors and countermeasures that neutralized Nod's stealth technology, but Nod continued to evolve the science of stealth, and the "stealth arms race" has continued unabated ever since.\n\nNod's new stealth technology is allowing a number of their vehicles and units to successfully evade detection by most current-gen GDI sensors. As a result, Nod stealth units are proving brutally effective against our forces in the field. Nod has clearly leapfrogged GDI in stealth technology and countermeasures.\n\nGDI field commanders should be aware that the latest G-Tech sensors are required for detection of Nod stealth units. Unfortunately, the newest sensors are not widely deployed. Only Falcon hovercraft scout vehicles, Outposts, and base defenses come standard with the latest stealth detecting technology. Other units like Zone Troopers, Zone Raiders, or Commandoes must be upgraded with Scanner Packs, and Orca aircraft can be equipped with Sensor Pods or use a recharging pulse scan to detect nearby hidden enemies.\n\nNote that units equipped with stealth technology can sustain the stealth field while inactive or moving, but once any offensive action is taken, the field will break down and the unit will become visible. Also, there are reports that Nod has constructed a stealth disruption tower that can project a field large enough to encompass multiple units and even structures. It's conceivable that Nod forces could cloak an entire base."

Each base defense consists of four components: A central hub and three turrets that can be deployed within a radius of the hub (the hub is the heart of the defense system and controls all of the associated turrets). A hub can repair and even rebuild the three turrets that are slaved to it. To take out one of these new base defenses, destroy the hub. That's the only way to make sure the structure is neutralized for good. Also, commanders should note that these new defenses are being deployed in three distinct flavors: Anti-vehicle, anti-infantry, and anti-aircraft. Anti-vehicle defenses employ lasers, anti-aircraft turrets fire SAM missiles, and the anti-infantry turrets use an array of gun barrels that fire massive blasts of shrapnel almost like giant shotguns."

Early forms of Tiberium were almost organic, sprouting out of the ground in what seemed to be plant-like pods, leaching minerals out of the earth and emitting clouds of toxic gas. Over time, Tiberium showed it had the ability to evolve and change.\n\nBy 2047, most Tiberium on Earth has manifested in what we know as its most common form: A self-replicating proton lattice that turns any matter it touches into more of itself, giving off powerful radiation in the process. It can change anything it comes into contact with into more Tiberium.\n\nIs Tiberium terraforming the Earth into a planet suitable for alien life? Is it a weapon? Is it a creature of some kind? Perhaps some form of consciousness resides in the crystal lattices, a quantum crystalline brain that grows ever smarter as it grows and grows. There are many theories about what Tiberium actually is...and why it is here. Ultimately its origin and its purpose - if it has one - are still a mystery.\n\nGDI has not given up on trying to contain the spread of Tiberium. With Tiberium infestation reaching critical levels and new, more sinister variants of the substance turning up, things started to look pretty grim for planet Earth in the middle of the 21st century. However, GDI has found a vulnerability in the green crystal that they have begun to exploit. GDI engineers have found the resonant frequency for Tiberium...and they have created sonic resonators that are capable of breaking up Tiberium crystals.\n\nA high level scientific explanation of the alien substance is included here for students, engineers, and scientists: The most recent form of Tiberium is a dense "dynamic proton lattice" held together by exotic heavy particles. When Tiberium comes into contact with other matter, the heavy particles randomly collide with the nuclei of the target matter, smashing it to pieces (in the case of smaller nuclei) or incrementally knocking off protons or neutrons (in the case of heavier nuclei). Tiberium captures a fraction of the protons that are ejected during this collision process and incorporates them into its own structure, thus transmuting matter into more Tiberium. Whenever one of the heavy particles - a muon or tauon - collides with an atomic nucleus, fission occurs, which results in the production of alpha, beta, and gamma radiation as well as other forms of electromagnetic radiation (like infra-red). During the transmutation process, nuclei that Tiberium has come into contact with may be changed into nuclei with different (usually fewer) numbers of protons or neutrons."

IDB:005_GDI_Background_114_About_The_Brotherhood_body
"GDI views Nod as a dangerous, virulent, and inexplicably self-sustaining terrorist group obsessed with accelerating the worst ecological catastrophe in history, led by a charismatic and brilliant sociopath named Kane. The Brotherhood sees itself quite differently. Nod believes that it is the agent of change for a world in the throes of transition to a new order, the representative of the poor and the oppressed, and a foil to the previously unchecked power of GDI.\n\nNod has the people, resources, organization, and raw military power necessary to stand against GDI and wage war on a global scale. Yet the Brotherhood of Nod isn't a country; it's a strange new hybrid organization that has the combined characteristics of a religious movement, a multinational corporation, and a nation-state. Given the awesome demands of modern warfare, with its terrible cost and vast scale, Nod's ability to go toe-to-toe with GDI is astonishing.\n\nNod is able to recruit thousands of new members every month from the desperate populations of the borderlands. Their political, military, and logistical operations are decentralized and buried deep inside crumbling cities, towns, and outposts in the decaying Yellow Zones. A vast and sophisticated infrastructure is disguised from GDI, and Nod has perfected the art of moving military assets and forces quickly over long distances without detection, even by satellite or drone aircraft with the latest generation sensors.\n\nNod's core organization is very sophisticated and high-tech but they also have a large guerilla force composed of hastily trained and minimally equipped recruits from the Yellow Zones. Nod's field forces are an interesting mix of low tech "militia" troops and smaller numbers of highly trained, elite soldiers equipped with state of the art communications gear and the most advanced weapon systems available.\n\nNod's military assets are experimental and exotic in both appearance and function, but the durability of their units is suspect. Nod engineers are not afraid to risk human life and will often sacrifice safety and protection for increased abilities and speed. Their high-end military hardware runs on Tiberium and tends to be fast but vulnerable, lethal but unstable. Nod offensive weapons deployed on vehicles range from rockets, machine guns, flame throwers, lasers, and nuclear weapons. They also have a number of Tiberium-based weapons."

"The Global Defense Initiative began as a secret military alliance of advanced nations under the United Nations umbrella. GDI's mission: To contain Tiberium, reverse its spread, and fight the sinister Brotherhood of Nod.\n\nOver time, power and sovereignty have been gradually ceded to GDI and the national identities of the participating countries have faded. In 2047 that process has reached its final stages: While there are still technically individual Member Nations, the reality is that GDI has become a unified political and military super-state.\n\nGDI controls the only areas of the Earth that have not been significantly compromised by Tiberium infestation. The crystalline alien substance is slowly consuming the rest of the planet, causing an environmental cataclysm that has made 30% of the Earth uninhabitable and another 50% of the Earth's surface exceedingly unfriendly to civilization. GDI's home territories are known as "Blue Zones" since they are mostly clear of Tiberium and have been relatively untouched by war (in contrast to the ecologically ravaged and war-torn "Yellow Zones" and the Tiberium infested hellscapes designated as "Red Zones").\n\nThe clash between GDI and Nod has escalated into full world wars twice before - the First Tiberium War (TWI) erupted when both powers were in their formative states and that terrible war was followed by another worldwide Firestorm several years later."

"What happens if you're exposed to Tiberium? Nothing good. If you come into direct contact with Tiberium, the green matter will start to fuse with your skin within about 20 seconds. You'll feel an intense burning sensation, similar to touching a hot pan or spilling acid on your skin. A full blown infection will manifest if you aren't treated immediately. Your flesh will begin to take on a glassy-greenish appearance as it begins to crystallize; eventually your internal organs will shut down as Tiberium extends rigid crystalline runners throughout your body. If you breathe in the crystal, then it will become embedded in your lungs. You'll lose the ability to process oxygen as your lung tissue crystallizes. Eventually you'll start coughing up blood and will hemorrhage to death.\n\nIn some cases - and for unknown reasons - Tiberium infection will trigger cellular mutation. It's not cancer in that the mutations seem strangely directed; they don't kill you, but your body will begin to transform. The mechanism for this mutation is not well understood."

"Tiberium infestation has rendered 30% of the planet totally uninhabitable. Large swaths of the Earth's surface have been designated as "Red Zones" - areas that are desolate, swept by ion storms, and contaminated by vast amounts of Tiberium. Venturing into, over, or even near these wastelands can be extremely dangerous.\n\nBeyond the Red Zones, Tiberium contamination has caused varying levels of environmental damage in another 50% of the Earth's populated areas. In the ecologically compromised and war torn Yellow Zones, Tiberium fields are common - growing in the middle of cities, on farmland, and throughout the environment. Tiberium-related climate change has caused an endless cycle of droughts, floods, and severe weather of all types including spectacular Category 6 hurricanes, tornadoes with wind speeds of 500 miles per hour, and exceedingly violent thunderstorms. Especially destructive Ion Storms occasionally rage out of the Red Zones to wreak havoc on cities and towns in the borderlands.\n\nOnly 20% of the Earth's surface is in relatively pristine condition. Blue Zones suffer from minimal Tiberium infestation and have been relatively untouched by war. The populations of the Blue Zones live in relative comfort, going about their lives in high-tech futuristic cities that sit in forested valleys or nestle in pastoral farmland."

IDB:005_GDI_Background_222_Yellow_Zone_Life_body
"Tiberium contamination affects Yellow Zones directly and indirectly. Climate change, melting glacial ice, extreme weather, Tiberium field growth, and decades of war have caused social collapse in several Yellow Zones. Many cities in the most afflicted areas are run by warlords and criminal organizations or have degenerated into anarchy - or they have fallen under the thrall of the sinister Brotherhood of Nod.\n\nExistence in the worst-off Yellow Zones is not pleasant at all. Your home is likely to be in a decaying building with no running water. Power comes on for a few hours a day at erratic times. Food is scarce. Doctors are rare. On a few occasions food aid or medical care will be provided by humanitarian workers visiting from the pristine and high tech Blue Zones.\n\nA subsistence living is just the start. Tiberium contamination is a fact of life, and thousands die every year from inhaling microscopic crystals that are carried in smog, clouds of dust, and other airborne particulates. Tiberium may even fall out of the sky suspended in rain drops if the clouds overhead have passed through a Red Zone during or after an Ion Storm. Because of the drought conditions in many Yellow Zones, rain showers are often greeted by the local populations with an odd mix of fear, dread, and joy.\n\nIn the harsh reality of a Yellow Zone, Tiberium is not the only threat. If Tiberium doesn't get you, then you are likely to fall victim to a violent crime, get caught in the crossfire between warlords clashing over turf, or become a collateral damage statistic in the global war between the armies of the Global Defense Initiative and the Brotherhood of Nod."

IDB:005_GDI_Background_241_GDI_Nuclear_Weapons_body
"GDI still possesses a nuclear arsenal stored at key locations around the world (including a large nuke base in the desolate outback of Australia, heavily defended silos in North American Yellow Zones, and installations in other remote areas). GDI leaders long ago made a vow not to ever use nuclear weapons no matter how bad the situation got and kept that vow even as Nod acquired its own nuclear capability. GDI's nukes are few in number but are stored with delivery systems (including ICBMs) and kept at top operational readiness just in case GDI leaders ever change their minds. The most difficult test of GDI nuclear policy came in the early days of TW3 right after the strike on the Philadelphia, but even then it's questionable how effective nukes would have been in stemming the Nod tide given that Nod's forces were highly decentralized and Nod troops were staging operations deep in GDI Blue Zones. Some view GDI's pledge not to use nukes as a cynical one given that they deployed a new precision weapon of mass destruction - the Ion Cannon - right at the time they made their vow."

"If you were to equip yourself with a hardened environment suit and stand in the middle of a Red Zone, you would see a landscape straight out of hell. The ground is a blasted and barren plateau of rock laced with veins of Tiberium that shine through with a malevolent green radiance. On the horizon are massive formations of pure Tiberium that have welled up through the surrounding earth. These frozen crystalline glaciers cast a sickly emerald glow on the surrounding terrain. Tilt your head and you'll contemplate a cloudy, tortured sky alive with twisting patterns of shimmering light and flickers of lightning. If you wait long enough, you'll see an Ion Storm begin to form, the lightning overhead intensifying until the entire environment is lit with rapid strobing flashes. Eventually the vast and terrible energy overhead will begin arcing to the ground around you in a terrifying display of destructive force. These fireworks are accompanied by a howling toxic whirlwind that scours the deserted ground and drives shards of Tiberium before it at insane speeds.\n\nRed Zones are like the surface of an alien world. Scientists have speculated that Tiberium is actually a terraforming agent for an alien civilization, slowly transforming our world into an environment suitable for beings that have evolved on a different planet. No definitive conclusions have been reached."

"Red Zones are the most hostile operational environments on the planet. The abundance of Tiberium fields, the toxic radiation, the intimidating terrain (including chasms and cliffs), the terrible weather, and the huge Tiberium glaciers, all contribute to make these hellscapes a nightmare for field commanders. On the bright side, considering our resources and mobility, we have found that Red Zone conditions don't completely jeopardize our fighting ability. The following operational techniques are found to be the most effective in Red Zone combat actions:\n\n- Jump Jets: our Commandos, Zone Troopers, and Zone Raiders make the best use of GDI technology by simply jumping across the wide swathes of hostile terrain.\n\n- Calling For Transport: the ground terrain poses serious challenges that can be circumvented by bringing in a V-35 Ox to move units around.\n\n- Expanding Ground Control: ground control can sometimes expand build radius beyond the length of a chasm, allowing units to be produced on the other side. In addition, transporting Surveyors across chasms can allow for base construction on the other side."
