	<h3>Custom Maps</h3>
<h4>Basic Explanation</h4>
<p>With the updated version of Worldbuilder it is possible to build maps which use new assets added with your mod.  To do so you need to edit the
	configuration file for Worldbuilder to load your mod.  After the mod is created, there is nothing else you need to do, simply launch your mod in
	C&amp;C 3 and play on your new map.
</p>
<h4>Configuring Worldbuilder</h4>
<p>To launch Worldbuilder with a mod, you have to edit the CNC3_wb_1.0.cfg file, located in the root of your C&amp;C 3 directory.  You will need to add
a line similar to the following to the top of the file:</p>
<p class="code">try-add-config C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;your username&gt;\My Documents\Command &amp; Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars\mods\SampleMod\SampleMod_1.0_SkuDef
</p>
<p>This will tell Worldbuilder to attempt to load your mod, and allow you to create maps using the new assets added in your mod.</p>

<h4>Custom 
Maps and Overrides</h4>
	<p>If you have created map that 
	uses an override you will need to build this map using the 
	BinaryAssetBuilder.&nbsp; We have supplied a batch file to do this for you.&nbsp; 
	Simply run the BuildMap.bat from the root of the MOD SDK install directory 
	passing it the name of your map.&nbsp; For example:</p>
	<p class="code">BuildMap.bat SampleMap</p>
	<p>This file will copy your map 
	to a location so it can be built then copy the output files into your map 
directory.&nbsp; This is required when using overrides.</p>
