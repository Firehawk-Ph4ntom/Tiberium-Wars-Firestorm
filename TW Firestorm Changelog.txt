  > The Nod AI no longer purchases upgrades in this mission

- Edited the GDI "Downed Airbase" Mission:
  > Sniper Teams are now considered "Friendly" to the player, to prevent accidental deaths (unless force fired upon of course)

- Adjusted the respawn timers for all GDI Base Defenses in the following Nod and Scrin missions: "Our Secrets Exposed", "Guns of Hinderance", "Infidels on Holy Ground", and "Confiscate Information"

- Edited the GDI "Facility Of Terror" Mission:
  > Adjusted the Growth Rate Delay of all Tiberium Fields, lowering the Northern Blue Tiberium Field Growth Rate Delay from 60s to 30s, and lowering the Growth Rate Delay of the 2 Green Tiberium Fields from 12 to 8

    > The values are now:
      > (30s-60s) on EASY, (15s-30s) on NORMAL, (7s-15s) on HARD for the Secondary GDI AI (Active during the Phase Generator Defense Phase)
      > (15s-30s) on EASY, (7s-15s) on NORMAL, (3s-7s) on HARD for the Main GDI AI (Active after the Phase Generator Defense Phase)

- Edited the Nod "Components Of Salvation" Mission:

  > Lowered the Growth Rate Delay on the expansion Blue Tiberium Field from 12s to 11s, and lowered the Growth Rate Delay of the expansion Green Tiberium Fields from 9 to 7
  > Lowered the duration of when the GDI and Nod AI would switch focus target to the Player:
    > The Nod AI will switch targets to the Player for 75s now instead of 120s
    > The GDI AI will switch targets to the Player for 90s now instead of 120s
    > Increased the timer of the Nod AI staying focused on the GDI AI from 420s to 480s

    (This way, both AIs will attack the player at different points of the mission, not at the same time)

- Edited the Nod "A Traitor's Reward" Mission:
  > Edited the Nod AI State of using "Vertigo Bombers" against the Player, it is now based on an interval rather than constant
