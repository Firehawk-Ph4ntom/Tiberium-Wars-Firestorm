  TW Firestorm V1.8 Changelog

=========================================================================

=====================================================

Global:

Skirmish AI edits:

- Lowered the delay for unit build times for EASY and MEDIUM difficulty. Easy AI now has a unit build interval of 60s while Medium AI has a unit build interval of 30s
- MEDIUM difficulty no longer uses engineers to flank and capture enemy structures. This is now only reserved for HARD and BRUTAL

- Finally fixed Scrin AI's strange behavior of training an Explorer at the start of the game and sending them to the player's starting Tib field
  > (If multiple Scrin AI's are present, they would all send the Explorer to that one person's field)

-------------------------------------------------

New additions/Removals and MISC changes:

- Edited the Generic death voice lines of units that use it. Most death lines from KW are now included in the list (Before it was just TW)

- Multiplayer Beacons now have a limited lifetime of 90s
  > Made Multiplayer Beacons more visible in WB


Bug Fixes:

- Fixed Mutant Viceroids not having their specific WB Marker and using the Nod Fanatic marker

- Fixed Mutant Viceroids having a chance to turn into a normal viceroid once killed by Tiberium weapons

- Fixed a major bug where if a player is GDI/Nod and they place down a beacon as the MCV Drop Pod is spawning in, the game would result in an instant defeat
  > Also this change fixed the Drop Pods spawning in randomly around the starting position. Now the spawn point is centered and fixed


Balance changes:

- Lowered the experience gained from killing normal Viceroids from 1000 to 500
