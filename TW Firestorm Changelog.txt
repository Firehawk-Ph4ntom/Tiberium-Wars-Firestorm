=====================================

GDI Changes:

- MARV no longer EMPs itself when using the Overload Beam ability

- Zone Commando will now deal 50% extra damage to Tiberium Crystals

=====================================

Nod Changes:

- NODAscendedSquad_Veteran is no longer referenced (They were removed in 1.6)

- Removed FS_Factory Kindof from Nod Emissaries

- Tiberium Troopers can now heal allied scrin units (A full squad has half the healing potential of a Corrupter)
  > Lowered the damage of Tiberium Troopers after Blue Tiberium Core upgrade from 7 to 4.5 (Their base damage before the Damage over time kicks in)

- Lowered the damage of Tiberium Vein Detonation from 200 to 75 to all NON-infantry targets (Lowered the damage of Blue Tiberium Vein Detonation from 300 to 100)
  > Instead both of them have a 315% scalar vs vehicles and Tiberium Crystals)
  > This way the Vein Detonation will have enough to kill some Tiberium Crystals (not all of them like before) + It won't deal as much damage to structures and vehicles anymore (Overall damage to vehicles has been reduced from before)

- Fixed the damage scalar of Catalyst missile to Reaper Cyborgs and the Cyborg Commando
  > Catalyst Missile will now deal significant increased damage to Viceroids and all Tiberium Fiends

- Tiberium Troopers can now kill all viceroids - whether they are enemy ones or spawned by the Tiberium Troopers themselves

- Fixed the damage of Marauders before Charged Particle Beams upgrade (Their Damage scalar to vehicles and aircraft was bugged - Also lowered the value from 500% to 200% scalar)

- Fixed weapon Scatter of Specters, Leviathan, and Dark Twilight

=====================================

Scrin Changes:

- All Scrin Aircraft and Annihilator Tripod Husks now have the TIBERIUM_BASED kindof

- Scrin Explorers and Slaved Buzzers (from Buzzer Hive and from the Planetary Annihilator) now have the HEALED_BY_TIBERIUM Kindof

- Added TIBERIUM_BASED and HEALED_BY_TIBERIUM kindofs to the Wall Hub (just like the Wall Segment)

- Added a new unit for Scrin: The Stingray!
  > This unit is able to destroy missile and plasma disc projectiles as well as charge up Storm Columns!

- Fixed a damage oversight on the Overlord's Wrath superweapon

- Increased the ability range of Charge Defenses ability on Shock Troopers from 100 to 250
  > Fixed a bug where the ability could be used on any allied unit/structure
  > Overall improved the performance of the ability (Shock Troopers will no longer act weird when ordered to use the ability)

- Ion Storms now destroy missile projectiles instead of deflecting them
  > Ion Storms can now destroy Plasma Disc projectiles

- Corrupters can now kill all viceroids - whether they are enemy ones or spawned by the Corrupter itself

- Ravagers' Blue shards will now deal 15% extra damage to structures like it does with its normal green shards

- Fixed the texture of Overlord's Wrath Tiberium Shaft Crystals
