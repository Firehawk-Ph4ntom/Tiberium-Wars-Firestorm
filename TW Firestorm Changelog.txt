Global:

Skirmish AI edits:

- Lowered the unit build time delay for EASY and MEDIUM difficulty. Easy AI now has a unit build interval of 60s while Medium AI has a unit build interval of 30s

- MEDIUM difficulty no longer uses Engineers to flank and capture enemy structures. This is now only reserved for HARD and BRUTAL difficulties

- EASY AI now captures Neutral structures and unit husks

- Edited the percentage cash gain of AI difficulties (150% on EASY and MEDIUM, 175% on HARD, 200% on BRUTAL)

- Refined the opening build orders of all AI personalities:
  > Some builds before set them on low power due to insufficient power plants - All AI builds will no longer go into low power mode
  > All AIs now build extra harvesters and basic infantry at the start of the game
  > Tweaked the AI structure build order queues
  > All AI personalities and opening moves now utilize cranes

- AI will start sending engineers to capture enemy buildings ONLY AFTER 100 seconds have passed in-game from the beginning of the match

- When ammo is depleted on AI-controlled GDI Orcas, Firehawks, Nod Vertigoes, and Banshees, they will return to their airfield, and the AI won't mindlessly use them to roam around the map without ammo and suicide them. Instead, they will now wait until their ammo is fully replenished
-------------------------

-------------------------
- Changed how Purifying Laser and Firestorm Ignition work, the DOT from both now follow a consistent formula (with an exceptional rule for Obelisks and Purifier Warmechs):

>
  Purifying Laser total damage = Unit's base weapon damage x 1.5

  EX: 400 base damage
  Purifying Laser total damage: 400 x 1.5 = 600

  However, we want DOT over 3 seconds, so 600 - 400 = 200 (the total damage that needs to be added onto the base damage)
  200 / 3 seconds = 66.6666 (67 damage divided across 3 seconds) -> if there is a decimal number, it gets rounded

  Firestorm Ignition follows the same formula as Purifying Laser, but instead of total damage being equal to base weapon damage x 1.5, it's base weapon damage x 1.25
>
