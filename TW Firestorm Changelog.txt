=====================================================

Scrin Changes:

New additions/Removals and MISC changes:

- Scrin Explorers and Slaved Buzzers (from Buzzer Hive) can now be healed by Tiberium

- Added a new unit for Scrin: The Stingray!
  > This unit is able to destroy missile and plasma disc projectiles as well as charge up Storm Columns!

- Ion Storms now destroy missile projectiles instead of deflecting them
  > Ion Storms can now destroy Plasma Disc projectiles

- Fixed the texture of Overlord's Wrath Tiberium Shaft Crystals

- Added Power Signature Scan support power to the Nerve Center

- Overall Improved Mothership Explosion Particle Effects

- Added debris to Warp Chasm in REALLYDAMAGED state, and fixed REALLYDAMAGED animation

- Disintigrators now turn towards the target they are aiming at if they aren't moving

- Added a "Global Stealth Scan" ability on the Control Node structure, using this ability will reveal all stealthed units and structures across the entire map. Starts on Cooldown, costs 2000$, and takes 2 minutes

- AI no longer uses "Teleport Eradicator" ability on the Eradicator Hexapod

- Edited Stasis shield support power, now it has a 3.5s delay before casting

- Added Ambient sounds to Assimilator and Corrupter when starting to move/walk
  > Gun Walker sounds replaced with shard walker sounds (lower-pitched gun walker)

- Players can now charge up their Devourer Tanks and Annihilator Tripods on Refineries if they have at least 3000 credits (was 10000 before)

- Renamed "Ionizing Armor" to "Ionized Hulls"

- Added a new upgrade to the Storm Obelisk: Retribution Storm!
  > Basically brings back the Ion Storm spawned by Ichor Harvesters on death, though a much more toned down version of what it was in early vanilla, and now through an upgrade

- Edited the sound effects of Eradicator Hexapod, Planetary Annihilator, and Mechapede. Before, they used all their sound effects for every action (Attack command using move and select sound effects, move command using attack and select sound effects, etc..)

- New buildup models for various structures: Wall Hub/Segment, Terraforming Nexus, Phase Generator, Control Node, and Storm Obelisk

- Added subobjects to Eradicator Hexapod when Blink Packs upgrade is purchased

- If Blue Ichor Infusion upgrade has been purchased now before Shard Launchers, units/structures that have a plasma disc weapon by default (that usually get upgraded with shards) will now be upgraded to Blue Plasma Discs. The effectiveness of Blue Plasma Discs is still much less than Shard Launchers, but it still gives a significant damage boost from the default Plasma Discs.

  > Units/structures affected: Ravagers, Seeker Tanks, Planetary Annihilator and Conqueror Battleships' AA weapons, Photon Cannons, Plasma Missile Batteries, and Devastator Warships
  The stats of Blue Plasma Discs is the clipsize of Normal Plasma Discs + the damage of Blue Shard Launchers, but with Devastator Warships and Ravagers as an exception to this rule: (Stats of normal Shard Launchers is the damage of default Plasma Discs + double the clipsize)

    > Ravager's default weapon deals ROCKET damage, in which then Shard Launchers changes it to GUN damage. Also the number of projectiles fired is the same across the board (3 projectiles). Blue Plasma Discs still maintains 3 projectiles and ROCKET damage, but the damage value (100) is still a bit less than the damage of Shard Launchers (125)

    > For Devastator Warships, the clipsize is also constant whether upgraded or not (6 projectiles). The damage of Blue Plasma Discs gets upgraded to that of Blue Shards, but the AOE remaines unupgraded (10) as opposed to (25)

    (All in all though, Shard Launcher weapons take priority over Blue Plasma Disc Launchers)
