-------------------------------------------------
EVA Changes:

  > Increased the priority of "Low power" from 6 to 10

  > Lowered the priority of "Silos needed" from 3 to 2

  > Increased the priority of "Our building has been captured" from 6 to 8, and lowered the timeout time from 10s to 5s (if multiple player buildings were captured frequently, you would hear the voice line every 5s instead of 10s)

  > "Establishing Battlefield Control, Standby" and "Battle Control Online" will now always play from the player's base

  > Lowered the priority of "Building captured" and "Building captured, New powers available" from 6 to 4 and increased the timeout from 4s to 5s

  > Increased the priority of "Enemy base sighted" and "Enemy Unit sighted" from 3 to 5 and lowered the timeout from 30s to 15s

  > Lowered the timeout of "Harvester under attack" from 30s to 10s

  > Increased the timeout of "Cannot deploy here" from 1s to 7s

  > Made the expiration time of all EVA events to be consistent at 1s (it's the time when the EVA is busy aka it can't say anything else in this time) (Exceptions are all the superweapon events, which are at 6s)

  > Increased the priority of "Unit Under attack" from 3 to 4 and lowered the timeout of this EVA event from 30s to 25s

  > Made "Reinforcements under attack" and "Tiberium exposure detected" have the same settings as "Unit under attack"

  > Increased the priority of "Unit lost" from 3 to 5 and lowered the timeout of this EVA event from 60s to 40s

  > Increased the priority of "Harvester lost" from 8 to 10 and lowered the timeout from 30s to 10s

  > Increased the priority of "Warning, mothership deployed" from 5 to 8

  > Increased the priority of "Enemy Commando Detected" from 8 to 10, and lowered the timeout of this EVA event and for "Enemy engineer detected" from 30s to 15s

  > Increased the priority of "Stealth unit detected" from 5 to 8, and lowered the timeout of this EVA event from 30s to 15s

  > Lowered the priority for all of the support power EVA events ("Select Target", "Select Unit", "Select Dropzone", etc...) from 5 to 3

  > Lowered the priority of "Tiberium Field Depleted" from 5 to 3

  > Edited all "Objectives" EVA events ("Objective Complete", "New Bonus Objective received", etc..) to not to have the player "jump" to those objectives using spacebar. Now it is interesting, but all objectives have markers on them and a minimap icon, as well as when multiple objects are tied to the same objective, the "jump" command only goes to the first object linked. Similarly, if 2 objectives/transmissions are played after one another, the "jump" command will sometimes only go to the first object of the first played transmission. So I decided to remove the jump command from it as I felt that it was sort of useless/redundant

  > Lowered the priority of "Upgrade complete" from 6 to 4, and made the "jump" command not work on this EVA event

  > Lowered the priority of "Beacon Placed" from 10 to 4 and increased timeout of this EVA event from 1s to 8s

  > Increased the priority of "Beacon Detected" from 7 to 10 and lowered timeout of this EVA event from 15s to 8s

  > The "jump" command no longer works on "Intelligence data updated"

  This change was done to nerf the repair rate of Cyborgs by War Factory drones and nerf their heal rate when standing in Tiberium

- Mutant Viceroids no longer benefit from Ichor Plating, but now benefit from Advanced Articulators!
  > Cybernetic Augmentation upgrade was changed to give Mutant Viceroids an armor bonus instead of a speed bonus

- Edited the rate of Tiberium radiation healing:
  > Green Tiberium Crystals, fauna and flora, and Giant Green Tiberium crystals will heal all Scrin vehicles and Structures for 2% of their max hp every second, while healing Scrin infantry and Nod cyborgs for 4% of their max hp every second
