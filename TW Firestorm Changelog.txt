  TW Firestorm V1.8 Changelog

=========================================================================

=====================================================

Global:

Skirmish AI edits:

- Lowered the delay for unit build times for EASY and MEDIUM difficulty. Easy AI now has a unit build interval of 60s while Medium AI has a unit build interval of 30s
- MEDIUM difficulty no longer uses engineers to flank and capture enemy structures. This is now only reserved for HARD and BRUTAL

- Finally fixed Scrin AI's strange behavior of training an Explorer at the start of the game and sending them to the player's starting Tib field
  > (If multiple Scrin AI's are present, they would all send the Explorer to that one person's field)

-------------------------------------------------

New additions/Removals and MISC changes:

- Edited the Generic death voice lines of units that use it. Most death lines from KW are now included in the list (Before it was just TW)

- Multiplayer Beacons now have a limited lifetime of 90s
  > Made Multiplayer Beacons more visible in WB


Bug Fixes:

- Fixed Mutant Viceroids not having their specific WB Marker and using the Nod Fanatic marker

- Fixed Mutant Viceroids having a chance to turn into a normal viceroid once killed by Tiberium weapons

- Fixed a major bug where if a player is GDI/Nod and they place down a beacon as the MCV Drop Pod is spawning in, the game would result in an instant defeat
  > Also this change fixed the Drop Pods spawning in randomly around the starting position. Now the spawn point is centered and fixed

- Fixed the geometry of Blue, Red, and Redzone Tiberium Fields

- Fixed Veinhole veins dealing damage to Scrin Stingrays. It is a hovering unit, it shouldn't deal damage to them

- Fixed Sonic Emitter's Ion storm killer weapon not affecting Retribution Ion Storms

- Fixed the bullet impact effects of the Wolverine, it is now consistent with HE Ammo's effects (not a centered impact effect but rather plays side by side since there are 2 different tracers)

-------------------------

- Changed how Purifying Laser and Firestorm Ignition work, the DOT from both now follow a consistent formula (exceptional rule for Obelisk and Purifier):

>
  Purifying Laser total damage = Unit's base weapon damage x 1.5

  EX: 400 base damage
  Purifying Laser total damage: 400 x 1.5 = 600

  However, we want DOT, so 600 - 400 = 200 (the total damage that needs to be added onto the base damage)
  200 / 3 seconds = 66.6666 (67 damage divided across 3 seconds for DOT effect) -> if there is a decimal number, it gets rounded

  Firestorm Ignition follows the same formula as Purifying Laser, but instead of total damage being equal to base weapon damage x 1.5, it's base weapon damage x 1.25
>
