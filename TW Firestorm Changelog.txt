  TW Firestorm V1.8 Changelog

=========================================================================

=====================================================

Global:

Skirmish AI edits:

- Lowered the delay for unit build times for EASY and MEDIUM difficulty. Easy AI now has a unit build interval of 60s while Medium AI has a unit build interval of 30s

- MEDIUM difficulty no longer uses engineers to flank and capture enemy structures anymore. This is now only reserved for HARD and BRUTAL difficulties

- Finally fixed Scrin AI's strange behavior of training an Explorer at the start of the game and sending them to the player's starting Tiberium field
  > (If multiple Scrin AI's are present, they would all send the Explorer to that one person's field)

- Increased the percentage cash gain of non-brutal AI difficulties (150% on EASY, 175% on MEDIUM, 200% on HARD)

- Refined the opening build orders of all AI personalities:
  > Some builds before set them on low power due to insufficient power plants - they should not go into low power mode now
  > All builds now have the AI's build extra harvesters from their war factories and basic infantry at the start of the game
  > Tweaked the order of the builds (building a structure before the other)
  > All AI opening moves now use cranes

- AI will start sending engineers to capture enemy buildings ONLY AFTER 100 seconds has passed ingame from the beginning of the match

- AI no longer uses Minedrop support power on structures, aircraft, or husks
-------------------------------------------------

  > Adjusted the weaponset ordering of the unit, Cobra Commando will now prioritize distance between itself and targets (It will no longer go automatically to C4 vehicles despite enemy infantry being closer)

- Lowered the firing interval of Shadow Teams' laser weapon from 0.5s to 0.3s

- Marauder Tanks now deal 25% less damage to infantry when upgraded with Charged Particle Beams
  > Lowered their Firing Duration (time interval between each shot) from 0.2s to 0.1s
  > Increased movement speed from 120 to 130

- Added a damage scalar to the Incinerator Tower, they now deal 75% less damage to infantry (still deletes mass squads easily though cause the damage stacks the more infantry units are clumped up together)

-------------------------

- Changed how Purifying Laser and Firestorm Ignition work, the DOT from both now follow a consistent formula (with an exceptional rule for Obelisks and Purifier Warmechs):

>
  Purifying Laser total damage = Unit's base weapon damage x 1.5

  EX: 400 base damage
  Purifying Laser total damage: 400 x 1.5 = 600

  However, we want DOT, so 600 - 400 = 200 (the total damage that needs to be added onto the base damage)
  200 / 3 seconds = 66.6666 (67 damage divided across 3 seconds for DOT effect) -> if there is a decimal number, it gets rounded

  Firestorm Ignition follows the same formula as Purifying Laser, but instead of total damage being equal to base weapon damage x 1.5, it's base weapon damage x 1.25
>

Damage changes:

  > Each unit gives off the same buff, but the effect will now stack (Previously it didn't) if you have a variety of all those units together (i.e 6 Purifiers next to the Commando won't give off 6x the buff. However, having a Purifier + Emissary + Leviathan + Voice of Kane + Dark Twilight + Reckoner will give the Commando the buff x6)

  > As a result, the Rate of Fire buff was reduced from 150% to 120%, and armor buff reduced from 25% to 10%
  > Leviathan Airship now gives off the effect by default, no longer needing the Propaganda Speakers upgrade
  > Purifiers now require the Propaganda Speakers upgrade
