-------------------------

- Changed how Purifying Laser and Firestorm Ignition work, the DOT from both now follow a consistent formula (exceptional rule for Obelisk and Purifier):

>
  Purifying Laser total damage = Unit's base weapon damage x 1.5

  EX: 400 base damage
  Purifying Laser total damage: 400 x 1.5 = 600

  However, we want DOT, so 600 - 400 = 200 (the total damage that needs to be added onto the base damage)
  200 / 3 seconds = 66.6666 (67 damage divided across 3 seconds for DOT effect) -> if there is a decimal number, it gets rounded

  Firestorm Ignition follows the same formula as Purifying Laser, but instead of total damage being equal to base weapon damage x 1.5, it's base weapon damage x 1.25
>

  > Each unit gives off the same buff, but the effect will now stack (Previously it didn't) if you have a variety of all those units together (i.e 6 Purifiers next to the Commando won't give off 6x the buff. However, having a Purifier + Emissary + Leviathan + Voice of Kane + Dark Twilight + Reckoner will give the Commando the buff x6)

  > As a result, the Rate of Fire buff was reduced from 150% to 120%, and armor buff reduced from 25% to 10%
  > Leviathan Airship now gives off the effect by default, no longer needing the Propaganda Speakers upgrade
  > Purifiers now require the Propaganda Speakers upgrade
