-------------------------------------------------
EVA Changes:

  > Increased the priority of "Low power" from 6 to 10

  > Lowered the priority of "Silos needed" from 3 to 2

  > Increased the priority of "Our building has been captured" from 6 to 8, and lowered the timeout time from 10s to 5s (if multiple player buildings were captured frequently, you would hear the voice line every 5s instead of 10s)

  > "Establishing Battlefield Control, Standby" and "Battle Control Online" will now always play from the player's base

  > Lowered the priority of "Building captured" and "Building captured, New powers available" from 6 to 4 and increased the timeout from 4s to 5s

  > Increased the priority of "Enemy base sighted" and "Enemy Unit sighted" from 3 to 5 and lowered the timeout from 30s to 15s

  > Lowered the timeout of "Harvester under attack" from 30s to 10s

  > Increased the timeout of "Cannot deploy here" from 1s to 7s

  > Made the expiration time of all EVA events to be consistent at 1s (it's the time when the EVA is busy aka it can't say anything else in this time) (Exceptions are all the superweapon events, which are at 6s)

  > Increased the priority of "Unit Under attack" from 3 to 4 and lowered the timeout of this EVA event from 30s to 25s

  > Made "Reinforcements under attack" and "Tiberium exposure detected" have the same settings as "Unit under attack"

  > Increased the priority of "Unit lost" from 3 to 5 and lowered the timeout of this EVA event from 60s to 40s

  > Increased the priority of "Harvester lost" from 8 to 10 and lowered the timeout from 30s to 10s

  > Increased the priority of "Warning, mothership deployed" from 5 to 8

  > Increased the priority of "Enemy Commando Detected" from 8 to 10, and lowered the timeout of this EVA event and for "Enemy engineer detected" from 30s to 15s

  > Increased the priority of "Stealth unit detected" from 5 to 8, and lowered the timeout of this EVA event from 30s to 15s

  > Lowered the priority for all of the support power EVA events ("Select Target", "Select Unit", "Select Dropzone", etc...) from 5 to 3

  > Lowered the priority of "Tiberium Field Depleted" from 5 to 3

  > Edited all "Objectives" EVA events ("Objective Complete", "New Bonus Objective received", etc..) to not to have the player "jump" to those objectives using spacebar. Now it is interesting, but all objectives have markers on them and a minimap icon, as well as when multiple objects are tied to the same objective, the "jump" command only goes to the first object linked. Similarly, if 2 objectives/transmissions are played after one another, the "jump" command will sometimes only go to the first object of the first played transmission. So I decided to remove the jump command from it as I felt that it was sort of useless/redundant

  > Lowered the priority of "Upgrade complete" from 6 to 4, and made the "jump" command not work on this EVA event

  > Lowered the priority of "Beacon Placed" from 10 to 4 and increased timeout of this EVA event from 1s to 8s

- Added a new symbol to represent slowdown on Tiberium crystals/tiberium based weapons
  > Added a condition to represent both rage and slowdown side by side if affected by both (Also applies to supprssion symbol showing side by side with rage symbol if the infantry unit is affected by both)

- Added stealth to Beacons to prevent players on opposite teams from seeing them


Bug Fixes:

- Fixed Observation Post and Expansion Outpost not having an experience template

- Fixed the damage scalar of Disruptors' beam against Tiberium Crystals when heroic, it is now a 1800% scalar just like the regular beam 

- Players can no longer capture Fuel Depots as it resulted in a game crash if the structure was considered an enemy to the player

- Fixed Large Tiberium Chasm objects and Tiberium Crystals having the wrong Environment map texture

- Fixed all units with linear damage (such as Zone Shatterers, Seismic Troopers, Incinerator Tower, etc..) to not initially multiply their damage when fighting with infantry squads because of the invisible squad holder
  > Also fixed them dealing double damage to all tier 2 and tier 3 tech structures (Command Post, Tech Center, Operations Center, Tech Lab, Nerve Center, Technology Assembler)

Balance changes:

- Repair Civilian Building ability on all engineers has been made more responsive

- Removed the 20% damage reduction of Disruptors vs Structures
  > Increased the damage of the beam projectile from 15 to 20

- Ghost Stalker now remains stealthed in Tiberium Fields while moving

- Increased the cost of GDI Spy Satellite, Nod Eye Of Kane, and Scrin Control Node from 7000$ to 8000$ and increased power requirement from 20 to 40

- Increased the cost of all Barracks production structures from 500$ to 600$ and increased power requirement from 5 to 7

- All Construction Yards now give +15 power instead of +10

- Edited the power requirement of all defenses (All anti-infantry defenses consume 7 power, all basic anti-tank defenses consume 9 power, and all AA defenses consume 8 power)

- Lowered the health of Tiberium Floaters from 12000 to 6250
  > Lowered their attack damage from 2000 to 1000
  > Increased reload time from 4s to 5s

- Edited all defensive turrets' turret startup time from 1.5s to 0.5s (Except Nod SAM Turret which is unchanged at 2s, and all Scrin defense turrets being at 1s)
  > This makes the defensive turrets more responsive in attacking enemies after they are immediately built, they dont wait a while before attacking

-------------------------
- Lowered the armor of all Cyborg units by 400% (Cyborg Gunners, Ascended, Reaper Cyborg, Cyborg Commando, Decimator Cyborg, Obliterator Cyborg, Cyborg Hijacker)
  > Subsequently, buffed the hp of all Cyborg units by 400%
  This change was done to nerf the repair rate of Cyborgs by War Factory drones and nerf their heal rate when standing in Tiberium

- However, from there, the Cyborg Gunner and Ascended armor was then further edited:
  > Ascended armor no longer uses Zone Trooper armor, but instead the same armor template as Cyborg Gunners
  > As follows, the Cyborg Gunner armor increased:
    > Increased damage resistance to GRENADE damage by 100%
    > Increased damage resistance to GUN damage by 90%
    > Increased damage resistance to SNIPER damage by 110%
    (by 100%, 90%, and 110% it doesn't mean they are invulnerable, but rather for example, the armor template says that Cyborgs take 320% damage from SNIPER, now with 110% increased damage resistance, they now only take 210% damage from SNIPER)

  > Increased armor of heavy cyborgs (Reaper, Cyborg Commando, Cyborg Decimator, and Obliterator):
    > Increased damage resistance to GRENADE damage by 10%
    > Increased damage resistance to SNIPER damage by 20%

-------------------------

- Mutant Viceroids no longer benefit from Ichor Plating, but now benefit from Advanced Articulators!
  > Cybernetic Augmentation upgrade was changed to give Mutant Viceroids an armor bonus instead of a speed bonus

- Edited the rate of Tiberium radiation healing:
  > Green Tiberium Crystals, fauna and flora, and Giant Green Tiberium crystals will heal all Scrin vehicles and Structures for 2% of their max hp every second, while healing Scrin infantry and Nod cyborgs for 4% of their max hp every second
  > Blue Tiberium Crystals, fauna and flora, and Giant Blue Tiberium crystals will heal all Scrin vehicles and Structures for 3% of their max hp every second, while healing Scrin infantry and Nod cyborgs for 5% of their max hp every second
  > Red Tiberium Crystals will heal all Scrin vehicles and Structures for 4% of their max hp every second, while healing Scrin infantry and Nod cyborgs for 6% of their max hp every second

- Anti-garrison weapons with warheads such as Flame Tanks, Black Hands, Tiberium Troopers, etc.. will now deal x2 damage of their total weapon damage

- Zone Commando and Falcon Commando (Renamed vanilla Commando from Dropship Bay) can now spot for Behemoth / Specter Artillery bombardement

-------------------------------------------------
- Revised the shroud clearing range of units and structures:

  > Overall lowered the shroud clearing range of units down to 350, except for GDI Falcons, Nod Attack Bikes, and Scrin Razorbacks.
    > Increased the stealth detection of these 3 units to from 400 to 550 (they were all at 400)

  > This is to make these 3 units have more of a value late game, they would provide much better visibility on the battlefield and stealth detection than anything else

  An overview of the shroud clearing ranges atm:

    > All structures (excluding defenses, Superweapons, and Conyards): 400 shroud clearing range

    > All Defensive structures (whether built or spawned in via support power i.e Lightning Spike): 500 shroud clearing range

    > All MCVs and expansion units: 250

-------------------------------------------------
- Edited the locomotors for various units:
  > Edited Leviathan to turn around quicker than the other epic air units

  > Made Nod vehicles in general more nimble when moving/turning around such as Flame Tanks, Phantom, Spider Drone, Raider Buggy, Specter, MCV, and Stealth Tank)
    > Some other GDI and Nod vehicles turn around a tiny bit slower (Avenger Tank and Sandstorm)

  > All Walkers' locomotors have been changed to feel more natural when moving, (aka units like Behemoths, Redeemer, Purifier, Titan, Colossus, Dark Twilight, etc...) will now stop moving and turn on the spot when ordered to manuever around buildings instead of instantly turning around
    > Units like the Eradicator Hexapod and Planetary Annihilator will no longer snap into position when ordered to retreat and will keep turning around normally

  > All Harvesters' turn radius lowered from 40 to 30

  > Added a small bounce kick effect to Reckoners, ,MRTs, and Specters when moving, and increased the bounce kick effect of Raider Buggies and Attack Bikes

=====================================================

Scrin Changes:

New additions/Removals and MISC changes:

- Reverted Scrin Terraforming Nexus to be capturable again (This also means it should no longer crash the game when capturing an enemy Terraforming Nexus)

- Added a new projectile to Shock Troopers and Stormrider's proton cannon

- Added heroic lightning FX to Storm Columns, Stormriders, and Lightning Spike when upgraded with EMP Storm upgrade

- Edited the Reaver's firing FX

- Edited the decal of the Stasis Chamber when selected (the range of replenishing infantry) and made the healzone particle effects more visible

- Added subtle effects to units when healing through Tiberium radiation

- Retribution Storm upgrade now affects Stormriders and Stingrays

- Reworked the charge up ability of Stingrays and Shock Troopers:
  > Now only 1 Stingray or Shock Trooper is required to charge up the Storm Column, and it gets 50% more damage as a benefit instead of more attack range/rate of fire
  > The ability now works on Lightning Spikes
  > Added a new sound effect to Lightning Spikes and Storm Columns when firing and charged up

- Added 5 new units: Ichor Contaminator, Razorback, Hive Stalker, Ichor Wraith, and the Mobile Warp Beacon!
  > The Ichor Contaminator is a titan-like unit, replacing the Gun Walker as Scrin's new Tier-1 anti-infantry! It can crush heavy infantry and vehicles, is slow, and very well armored! It also fires the same weapon as the Infestation Spore Pod, so it is able to provide minor healing capabilities with its weapon

  > The Razorback is Scrin's new Tier-1 anti-tank scout unit, replacing the Seeker! It can detect stealth just like the Seeker, and is just as fast, however, it deals cannon damage, and is able to toggle between flight mode and land hovering mode just like RA3's Mecha Tengu, and can provide the player with easy maneuverability on the battlefield

  > Hive Stalker: Scrin's airborne infantry, good vs infantry, and comes in a squad of 4. It can detect stealth, is slow, but a tiny bit tanky.

  > Ichor Wraith: Akin to the stormrider, the Ichor Wraith is very mobile and is lightly armored. However, it spews out spore projectiles like the Contaminator, but the projectiles scatter in a large area around the target, and create radiation puddles that last for a short period of time. Very deadly towards infantry, and can be used to deal decent damage to base structures

  > Mobile Warp Beacon: Scrin has finally gotten a mobile airfield, home of the Hive Stalkers and Ichor Wraiths. You can also build Droneships and Razorbacks from here (which start in flying mode). The unit also has drones to defend itself!

- Added new explosion effects to Ichor Harvesters and some Tiberium effects to Corrupters when taking damage

- Assimilators no longer remain stealth while standing still, but instead stealth when standing in Tiberium Fields
  > Added a new ability: Phase Barrier! The Assimilator becomes somewhat invulnerable for 15 seconds when toggled, but is not able to capture or repair buildings

- Removed Shard Launchers upgrade! Instead, all units/structures affected by Shard Launchers will have them by default!
  > Renamed "Photon Cannon" to "Shard Cannon", and renamed "Plasma Missile Battery" to "Shard Missile Battery"


Bug Fixes:

- Fixed Stormrider dealing full damage to GDI Sandstorms, Stingray, and not dealing full damage to Spider Drones (it's supposed to only deal 25% of its total damage to AA vehicles)

- Fixed the formation preview height of the Droneship

- Fixed Shard Cannon not dealing proper extra damage to Civilian Buildings

- Fixed Irradiator Corrosive Field ability using wrong FireFX when upgraded with Blue Ichor Agglutination


Balance changes:

- Increased the AOE of Corrupter's Tiberium radiation from 50 to 60
  > Increased the AOE of Ichor Irradiator's Tiberium radiation from 50 to 70

- Ichor Irradiator's Corrosive Field now heal allied Mutant units, Scrin units and Nod Cyborgs
  > Changed the way the ability works, now will no longer require location input, but also multiple Irradiators can't be ordered to use their abilities together anymore (Can only order 1 at a time)

- Increased the damage of Stormrider's lightning weapon from 400 to 450

- Lowered the cost of Stingrays from 1300$ to 1200$
  > Lowered the firing duration from 2s to 1.5s

- Lowered the damage of Disintigrators from 16 to 15 (Before Blue Ichor Agglutination upgrade)

- Lowered the damage of Shard Cannon from 140 to 115
  > Lowered the damage of Shard Missile Battery from 250 to 200

- Buzzers will now auto-clear garrisons when moving past them, and when combined with a vehicle, will now deal their proper damage of insta-killing infantry (in addition to being able to clear garrisons)

- Increased the health of Storm Columns from 6400 to 6500

- Increased the cost of Mechapedes from 1500 to 1800
