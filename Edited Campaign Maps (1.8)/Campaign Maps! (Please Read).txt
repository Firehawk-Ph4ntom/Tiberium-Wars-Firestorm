Well Finally it's here! Vanilla Campaign maps edited to work with the mod properly. However, due to some complications, I am unable to package them inside the mod and overwrite the vanilla missions.

So, these are the map files themselves, all you have to do is to unzip the Edited Campaign Maps.zip into this directory: "C:\Users\(Your_Username)\AppData\Roaming\Command & Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars\Maps"

Now once you have done that, it should look like the picture that i packaged in the folder (How_your_maps_should_look_like.png) (Specifies the directory where the maps should go)

In the end, you should now be able to play the missions! Just load up the mod >> click skirmish >> Custom Maps

Your maps should appear there labeled for example:

- FS 1.8 - Scrin Act I (Mission 1) - London
- FS 1.8 - Scrin Act I (Mission 2) - Munich
- FS 1.8 - NOD Act I (Mission 1) - The White House
- FS 1.8 - NOD Act I (Mission 2) - Andrews Air Force Base

etc
Notice: These maps are exclusive to the Firestorm mod, so it will not work if played anywhere else

=====================
Enjoy playing!

If you do still have any questions on how to install the maps, you can message me on discord or on Moddb.

Also if you do have any suggestions on improvement on those missions, give me some feedback! I would appreciate it a lot
