Tiberium Wars Firestorm mod source code


This is the source code for Tiberium Wars Firestorm mod. It includes the vanilla CnC3 SDK by EA, plus some additional addons by bibber (not all)
Buildmod.bat and Buildmap.bat are custom made by me with the help of Jenkins.
You may download this source code and work with it as you please, everything is included here, from audio to art.

To compile the mod, just run buildmod.bat and type "Firestorm" in it's parameters and everything should work, though you might need some files to get it to run,
namely Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1, and .NET Framework version 2.0

Enjoy tinkering with these files i have given you! If you have any questions, ask me on discord.

You may need some basic knowledge on modding cnc3 if anything.
