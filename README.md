Tiberium Wars Firestorm mod source code


This is the source code for the Tiberium Wars Firestorm mod. It includes the vanilla CnC3 SDK by EA, plus some additional add-ons by Bibber (not all)
Buildmod.bat and Buildmap.bat are custom-made by me with the help of Jenkins.
You may download this source code and work with it as you please, everything is included here, from audio to art to all the mod files themselves.

To compile the mod, just run buildmod.bat and type "Firestorm" and the version number of your choice in its parameters and everything should work, though you might need some files to get it to run,
namely Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 and .NET Framework version 2.0

NOTE: If you type the version number too long, the game won't accept it, and crashes on startup. Another thing, the compiler will search for this path to automatically put the mod files in C:\Users\(Your User Name)\Documents\Command & Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars\Mods\Firestorm\"

Enjoy tinkering with these files I have given you! If you have any questions, ask me on Discord.

You may need some basic knowledge of modding cnc3.
