Once you gain access to an enemy structure be sure to disable the central computer terminal immediately and install your override program to connect the structure to the nearest command post.\n4.  When entering a damaged structure be sure to initiate damage control programs for immediate results. Once the automation has kicked in you will be clear to commence more extensive repairs.\n5.

Early forms of Tiberium were almost organic, sprouting out of the ground in what seemed to be plant-like pods, leaching minerals out of the earth and emitting clouds of toxic gas. Over time, Tiberium showed it had the ability to evolve and change.\n\nBy 2047, most Tiberium on Earth has manifested in what we know as its most common form: A self-replicating proton lattice that turns any matter it touches into more of itself, giving off powerful radiation in the process.  It can change anything it comes into contact with into more Tiberium.\n\nIs Tiberium terraforming the Earth into a planet suitable for alien life? Is it a weapon? Is it a creature of some kind? Perhaps some form of consciousness resides in the crystal lattices, a quantum crystalline brain that grows ever smarter as it grows and grows. There are many theories about what Tiberium actually is...and why it is here. Ultimately its origin and its purpose - if it has one - are still a mystery.\n\nGDI has not given up on trying to contain the spread of Tiberium. With Tiberium infestation reaching critical levels and new, more sinister variants of the substance turning up, things started to look pretty grim for planet Earth in the middle of the 21st century. However, GDI has found a vulnerability in the green crystal that they have begun to exploit. GDI engineers have found the resonant frequency for Tiberium...and they have created sonic resonators that are capable of breaking up Tiberium crystals.\n\nA high level scientific explanation of the alien substance is included here for students, engineers, and scientists: The most recent form of Tiberium is a dense "dynamic proton lattice" held together by exotic heavy particles. When Tiberium comes into contact with other matter, the heavy particles randomly collide with the nuclei of the target matter, smashing it to pieces (in the case of smaller nuclei) or incrementally knocking off protons or neutrons (in the case of heavier nuclei). Tiberium captures a fraction of the protons that are ejected during this collision process and incorporates them into its own structure, thus transmuting matter into more Tiberium. Whenever one of the heavy particles - a muon or tauon - collides with an atomic nucleus, fission occurs, which results in the production of alpha, beta, and gamma radiation as well as other forms of electromagnetic radiation (like infra-red). During the transmutation process, nuclei that Tiberium has come into contact with may be changed into nuclei with different (usually fewer) numbers of protons or neutrons."

"Tiberium infestation has rendered 30% of the planet totally uninhabitable.  Large swaths of the Earth's surface have been designated as "Red Zones" - areas that are desolate, swept by storms, and contaminated by vast amounts of Tiberium.  Venturing into, over, or even near these wastelands can be extremely dangerous.\n\nBeyond the Red Zones, Tiberium contamination has caused varying levels of environmental damage in another 50% of the Earth's populated areas.  In the ecologically compromised and war torn Yellow Zones, Tiberium fields are common - growing in the middle of cities, on farmland, and throughout the environment.  Tiberium-related climate change has caused an endless cycle of droughts, floods, and severe weather of all types including spectacular Category 6 hurricanes, tornadoes with wind speeds of 500 miles per hour, and exceedingly violent thunderstorms.  Especially destructive Ion Storms occasionally rage out of the Red Zones to wreak havoc on cities and towns in the borderlands.\n\nOnly 20% of the Earth's surface is in relatively pristine condition.  Blue Zones suffer from minimal Tiberium infestation and have been relatively untouched by war.  The populations of the Blue Zones live in relative comfort, going about their lives in high-tech futuristic cities that sit in forested valleys or nestle in pastoral farmland."

"Urban combat is a messy and dangerous business.  When fighting in a city environment, field commanders should use every advantage to minimize casualties.  Garrisoning civilian structures with infantry is a tactic that generates multiple rewards, including massive defensive bonuses and increased safety for the troops.  Buildings can provide cover and a fire base for infantry as they shoot at targets outside without being directly exposed to enemy fire.  Garrisoned buildings protect soldiers from heavy anti-personnel weapons mounted on vehicles. That being said, field commanders should be wary of enemy units that specialize in clearing garrisoned buildings, particularly those equipped with grenades and flamethrowers.  Remember: Caught in the cross-fire while you're out in the open?  Order your troops into a building."

"GDI views Nod as a dangerous, virulent, and inexplicably self-sustaining terrorist group obsessed with accelerating the worst ecological catastrophe in history, led by a charismatic and brilliant sociopath named Kane.  The Brotherhood sees itself quite differently.  Nod believes that it is the agent of change for a world in the throes of transition to a new order, the representative of the poor and the oppressed, and a foil to the previously unchecked power of GDI.\n\nNod has the people, resources, organization, and raw military power necessary to stand against GDI and wage war on a global scale.  Yet the Brotherhood of Nod isn't a country; it's a strange new hybrid organization that has the combined characteristics of a religious movement, a multinational corporation, and a nation-state.  Given the awesome demands of modern warfare, with its terrible cost and vast scale, Nod's ability to go toe-to-toe with GDI is astonishing.\n\nNod is able to recruit thousands of new members every month from the desperate populations of the borderlands.  Their political, military, and logistical operations are decentralized and buried deep inside crumbling cities, towns, and outposts in the decaying Yellow Zones.   A vast and sophisticated infrastructure is disguised from GDI, and Nod has perfected the art of moving military assets and forces quickly over long distances without detection, even by satellite or drone aircraft with the latest generation sensors.\n\nNod's core organization is very sophisticated and high-tech but they also have a large guerilla force composed of hastily trained and minimally equipped recruits from the Yellow Zones.  Nod's field forces are an interesting mix of low tech "militia" troops and smaller numbers of highly trained, elite soldiers equipped with state of the art communications gear and the most advanced weapon systems available.\n\nNod's military assets are experimental and exotic in both appearance and function, but the durability of their units is suspect.  Nod engineers are not afraid to risk human life and will often sacrifice safety and protection for increased abilities and speed.  Their high-end military hardware runs on Tiberium and tends to be fast but vulnerable, lethal but unstable.  Nod offensive weapons deployed on vehicles range from rockets, machine guns, and flame throwers to toxins, lasers, and nuclear weapons.  They also have a number of Tiberium-based weapons."

"The Global Defense Initiative began as a secret military alliance of advanced nations under the United Nations umbrella.

In 2047 that process has reached its final stages: While there are still technically individual Member Nations, the reality is that GDI has become a unified political and military super-state.\n\nGDI controls the only areas of the Earth that have not been significantly compromised by Tiberium infestation. The crystalline alien substance is slowly consuming the rest of the planet, causing an environmental cataclysm that has made 30% of the Earth uninhabitable and another 50% of the Earth's surface exceedingly unfriendly to civilization.  GDI's home territories are known as "Blue Zones" since they are mostly clear of Tiberium and have been relatively untouched by war (in contrast to the ecologically ravaged and war-torn "Yellow Zones" and the Tiberium infested hellscapes designated as "Red Zones").\n\nThe clash between GDI and Nod has escalated into full world wars twice before - the First Tiberium War (TWI) erupted when both powers were in their formative states and that terrible war was followed by another worldwide Firestorm several years later."

"Nod's Next-gen Stealth Technology Poses a Serious Threat \n \n In the first Tiberium war Nod scientists developed a cloaking device that could be mounted on a vehicle, a stealth generator that created an energy field that could literally bend light around a particular object, rendering it invisible to the eye and to radar.  Nod first deployed this new technology on the infamous Stealth Tank.  GDI eventually developed new sensors and countermeasures that neutralized Nod's stealth technology, but Nod continued to evolve the science of stealth and the "stealth arms race" has continued unabated ever since. \n \n Nod's new stealth technology is allowing a number of their vehicles and units to successfully evade detection by most current-gen GDI sensors.  As a result, Nod stealth units are proving brutally effective against our forces in the field. Nod has clearly leapfrogged GDI in stealth technology and countermeasures. \n \n GDI field commanders should be aware that the latest G-Tech sensors are required for detection of Nod stealth units.  Unfortunately, the newest sensors are not widely deployed.  Only GDI Pitbull scout vehicles and base defenses come standard with the latest stealth detecting technology.  Other units like Zone Troopers must be upgraded with Scanner Packs, and Orca aircraft can be equipped with Sensor Pods or use a recharging pulse scan to detect nearby hidden enemies.  \n \n Note that units equipped with stealth technology can sustain the stealth field while inactive or moving, but once any offensive action is taken, the field will break down and the unit will become visible. Also, there are reports that Nod has constructed a stealth disruption tower that can project a field large enough to encompass multiple units and even structures.

Of most concern to InOps is evidence of significant progress towards the creation of a Liquid Tiberium device of unprecedented destructive power.  The liquid form of Tiberium is a relatively new manifestation of the alien substance and its properties are not well known.  Nod's Liquid Tiberium research appears to be 5 to 10 years ahead of Science Division.\n\nThere were also indications that Nod is working on a more conventional airborne Tiberium explosive and a catalyst for detonating existing Tiberium crystal deposits in a sub-critical reaction.\n\nAnalysis of past Nod R&D efforts (which tend to be redundant and decentralized in nature) suggests the Nod lab in North Africa was only one of several facilities participating in the Tiberium weaponization efforts."

It replaces the older "Devil's Tongue" last used in TW2.\n\nFlame Tanks are devastating against all forms of infantry and can clear out garrisoned buildings with terrifying efficiency.  InOps advises field commanders to engage Flame Tanks with armored vehicles or aircraft firing cannons or rockets. The enclosed crew compartments in armored vehicles will also protect against the inferno generated by the flame throwers."

With its twin rail guns, battlefield dominance, and unusual boxy profile, the Mk. II became an iconic symbol of freedom during the second Tiberium War. Its discontinuation has been greeted by many with anger, notably Captain Nick "Havoc" Parker, retired war hero, popular conservative pundit, and noted proponent of the "Kane lives" theory. \n \n "The Mark II was and continues to be one of our most powerful tools in the war against Nod fanaticism.

You'll feel an intense burning sensation, similar to touching a hot pan or spilling acid on your skin.  A full blown infection will manifest if you aren't treated immediately.  Your flesh will begin to take on a glassy-greenish appearance as it begins to crystallize; eventually your internal organs will shut down as Tiberium extends rigid crystalline runners throughout your body.  If you breathe in the crystal, then it will become embedded in your lungs.  You'll lose the ability to process oxygen as your lung tissue crystallizes.  Eventually you'll start coughing up blood and will hemorrhage to death. \n \n In some cases - and for unknown reasons - Tiberium infection will trigger cellular mutation.

"Tiberium contamination affects Yellow Zones directly and indirectly. Climate change, melting glacial ice, extreme weather, Tiberium field growth, and decades of war have caused social collapse in several Yellow Zones.  Many cities in the most afflicted areas are run by warlords and criminal organizations or have degenerated into anarchy - or they have fallen under the thrall of the sinister Brotherhood of Nod. \n \n Existence in the worst-off Yellow Zones is not pleasant at all.  Your home is likely to be in a decaying building with no running water.  Power comes on for a few hours a day at erratic times.  Food is scarce.  Doctors are rare.  On a few occasions food aid or medical care will be provided by humanitarian workers visiting from the pristine and high tech Blue Zones. \n \n A subsistence living is just the start.  Tiberium contamination is a fact of life, and thousands die every year from inhaling microscopic crystals that are carried in smog, clouds of dust, and other airborne particulates.  Tiberium may even fall out of the sky suspended in rain drops if the clouds overhead have passed through a Red Zone during or after an Ion Storm.  Because of the drought conditions in many Yellow Zones, rain showers are often greeted by the local populations with an odd mix of fear, dread, and joy. \n \n In the harsh reality of a Yellow Zone, Tiberium is not the only threat.  If Tiberium doesn't get you, then you are likely to fall victim to a violent crime, get caught in the crossfire between warlords clashing over turf, or become a collateral damage statistic in the global war between the armies of the Global Defense Initiative and the Brotherhood of Nod."

GDI leaders long ago made a vow not to ever use nuclear weapons no matter how bad the situation got and kept that vow even as Nod acquired its own nuclear capability.  GDI's nukes are few in number but are stored with delivery systems (including ICBMs) and kept at top operational readiness just in case GDI leaders ever change their minds.  The most difficult test of GDI nuclear policy came in the early days of TW3 right after the strike on the Philadelphia, but even then it's questionable how effective nukes would have been in stemming the Nod tide given that Nod's forces were highly decentralized and Nod troops were staging operations deep in GDI Blue Zones.  Some view GDI's pledge not to use nukes as a cynical one given that they deployed a new precision weapon of mass destruction - the Ion Cannon - right at the time they made their vow."

The earliest shelters were built after Ion Storms decimated population centers, including an incident resulting in the death of the famed Dr. Mobius and his top staff. Ion Storm Shelters are typically located between 10 and 30 meters below ground level, but no closer than 70 meters to significant deposits of underground water or Tiberium. Their construction includes 8 foot thick, steel-reinforced concrete walls with integrated sonic emitters to prevent nearby Tiberium growth. Newer shelters include dormitories, cafeterias, medical facilities, vehicle maintenance garages, long-term power generators and redundant sonic emitters. In high-risk areas some shelters have gained cultural significance as centers of social activity from sports to art and music events, gaining nicknames such as "Sector 7", "Old Blue" "The Hatch". \n \n In recent years many private organizations have developed smaller shelters for corporations and individuals at exorbitant prices. On rare occasion these private shelters link with official GDI shelters via underground tunnels. Private citizens with shelters that link to GDI public shelters are required by law to allow access to anyone who requests aid during class C emergencies and above. \n \n NOTE: Upon arrival at an unfamiliar Blue or Yellow Zone, take special care to familiarize yourself with the locations of nearby storm shelters.

This leads us to believe that the invaders are the Scrin, or perhaps some faction thereof. It is clear upon closer examination that this invasion force demonstrates acute differences from the source of the Tacitus in dialect and physical form. Perhaps they shared some distant connection, or there was some ancient contact between their cultures? \n \n One transmission we decoded using our most advanced decryption computers indicated alien chatter regarding another alien race they had previously encountered. We were unable to translate the word for the other alien race, but the encryption computer returned the terms brother, ascended, enemy and Scrin. This casts some confusion on the nature of the invaders, as they share a multitude of attributes with what we have come to know as the Scrin. It seems unlikely that this is the very same alien race that brought the Tacitus to Earth, but the connection is undeniable. \n \n If this is true, we should consider the Tacitus our most valuable military asset.

"‘I was about to go off the clock when the evacuate order came through. Klaxons, sirens, broadcasts on every channel. Even the damn billboards and street signs were telling us to get out of town. I called my wife, or tried, but every network was jammed...jammed or just static. We lived in the central district, worker family housing. I had been supervising the final touches on my chunk of the anti-Tib wall, out on the east side. Half a city away. \n \n Within ten minutes, I had abandoned my car and started to run. The vehicle exit points had jammed up less than ten minutes after the first alert, plunging the city into gridlock. Seconds later, I was sprinting past Holovision kiosks, and the ones that were still broadcasting, all I could see was destruction. Death. Fire... \n \n (the subject places head in hands, mutters inaudibly for 48 seconds) \n \n ...so I'm running and I start to hear this low hum. At first I think it's just the static from the public address system, gone dead a few minutes earlier. It isn't, it's something more. Like a machine, but alive, also, somehow. It starts to grow, the sound larger and larger as I sprint, and the sky is now dark, and the city walls are falling, the city walls I helped build...and there are things, things in the sky... \n \n  (the subject places head in hands, mutters inaudibly for 32 seconds) \n \n ...glowing, blue and glossy. Machines, but alive. I keep running. My lungs burn, my sides ache, but I'm getting close to the city. There's a thing in the sky, like the others, but huge, noise deafening, a massive ring, rotating around a central object, some kind of control pod. I am too close to take it all in, to know how it works. It's nearly over me, over central Berne, and now it is glowing, drawing up some kind of energy. \n \n I lower my head and run. \n \n For a second, everything is silent, as if the gigantic thing had sucked the sound right out of the air. Then light, everywhere, all consuming. I fall, shielding my eyes. \n \n Light, light and silence. \n \n When I come to, there...there is no central Berne, no worker family housing. All gone. Just a pit, gouged from the earth, a pit where a city used to be. At the center, there is something blue...blue and glittering...'"

"If you were to equip yourself with a hardened environment suit and stand in the middle of a Red Zone, you would see a landscape straight out of hell.  The ground is a blasted and barren plateau of rock laced with veins of Tiberium that shine through with a malevolent green radiance.  On the horizon are massive formations of pure Tiberium that have welled up through the surrounding earth.  These frozen crystalline glaciers cast a sickly emerald glow on the surrounding terrain.  Tilt your head and you'll contemplate a cloudy, tortured sky alive with twisting patterns of shimmering light and flickers of lightning.  If you wait long enough, you'll see an Ion Storm begin to form, the lightning overhead intensifying until the entire environment is lit with rapid strobing flashes.  Eventually the vast and terrible energy overhead will begin arcing to the ground around you in a terrifying display of destructive force.  These fireworks are accompanied by a howling toxic whirlwind that scours the deserted ground and drives shards of Tiberium before it at insane speeds.  \n \n Red Zones are like the surface of an alien world.  Scientists have speculated that Tiberium is actually a terraforming agent for an alien civilization, slowly transforming our world into an environment suitable for beings that have evolved on a different planet.  No definitive conclusions have been reached."

The aliens were able to keep the pressure on with a minimal numbers of units and crafty use of their Stasis Chamber and Mastermind.  We believe the Mastermind has more powers than just teleportation, but did not observe any additional capabilities directly. \n \n If Masterminds are deployed to the battlefield, field commanders should make it a priority to eliminate them ASAP.  The amount of mobility the Masterminds afford the alien invaders makes them a very high value target.

"Today the human race witnessed the destruction of a massive alien tower in one of the world's worst Red Zones.  The success of the mission shows all of us that there is hope - and that GDI is in a position to push back the invaders once and for all.  The question remains, however, what was the purpose of the tower? \n \n Alien towers have been constructed in nineteen Red Zones.  Their precise purpose is unknown but their location in the heart of the Tiberium infested hellscapes we call Red Zones indicates that they are somehow connected to the crystalline substance.  The alien retreat to the towers suggests a serious military realignment or a change of course by the invaders. \n \nWhile GDI scientists have been pushing to get a close-up analysis of the towers, military commanders have insisted their quick destruction is the primary concern.  If GDI is able to replicate the quick success of the Rome Tower mission in the other eighteen tower locations, their purpose may never be known."

"Red Zones are the most hostile operational environments on the planet.  The abundance of Tiberium fields, the toxic radiation, the intimidating terrain (including chasms and cliffs), the terrible weather, and the huge Tiberium glaciers all contribute to make these hellscapes a nightmare for field commanders.  On the bright side, considering our resources and mobility, we have found that Red Zone conditions don't completely jeopardize our fighting ability.  The following operational techniques are found to be the most effective in Red Zone combat actions: \n \n - Jump Jets: our commando and zone troopers make the best use of GDI technology by simply jumping across the wide swathes of hostile terrain. \n \n - Calling For Transport: the ground terrain poses serious challenges that can be circumvented by bringing in a V35 OX to move units around. \n \n - Expanding Ground Control: ground control can sometimes expand build radius beyond the length of a chasm, allowing units to be produced on the other side.  In addition, transporting Surveyors across the chasm can allow for base construction on the front lines."

"The alien Control Node at Ground Zero is a unique structure that seems to channel some form of exotic Tiberium-based radiation to the invader forces.  The emissions from the Control Node move easily through all forms of matter, much like neutrino wave/particles, and so this one node structure is easily able to bathe every invader unit and structure on Earth with the mysterious radiation.  In fact, this one Control Node could easily supply a uniform bath of radiation to alien units as far away as Earth's moon.  What is this radiation and why is it needed?  Is it for power?  Communications?  Synchronization? Coordination and control?  Does it provide something essential for the alien machines or the organic matter inside?  We don't know the answers to any of these questions, but we do believe that the Control Node is the key vulnerability for the aliens.  Take out the Control Node and there is a good chance the whole invasion will end quickly."

Most people do not realize that the roots of our faith extend back several millennia, long before the emergence of the green crystal on Earth in 1995... an event prophesized by our great leader, Kane.\n\nWhile the fascist political consortium of wealthy nations known as the Global Defense Initiative attempted to control the sacred green crystal, the Brotherhood worked tirelessly to acquire samples of the precious crystal... to study it, to unlock its potential as a new energy source, to explore its possibilities.   Through our research and our faith, we have affirmed that Tiberium is the ultimate gift to mankind.  It is the key to the future.\n\nOur movement grew rapidly as Tiberium spread across the Earth.  The mainstream media branded us as 'terrorists' but we exposed GDI as the real criminals.

This orbital necklace of death is based on a network of space-based kinetic kill weapons, lasers, and even the Ion Cannons themselves - used to intercept and destroy incoming missiles.  GDI space assets have been out of reach of the Brotherhood for years, leading to a sense that the balance of power in a decades-long struggle would eventually tip decisively against the Brotherhood.\n\nBut our operatives discovered a flaw in the GDI system: For some unfathomable reason, GDI put the crews and control centers for their Ion Cannons and their A-SAT system on the ground.  Even better, the critical personnel and equipment are concentrated in a single facility in the northeastern Blue Zone.  A well-planned surprise strike on Goddard Space Center could take all of GDI's Ion Cannons and their entire A-SAT system offline, giving the Brotherhood days and possibly weeks to conduct combat operations across the planet unhindered by space-based weapons and prying eyes.\n\nAs a bonus, the primary GDI world command hub is based on board the space station Philadelphia.  A missile strike on the Philadelphia immediately after the destruction of the A-SAT control systems could render the entire GDI command and control structure headless and reeling."

"...Nod forces are deploying a new generation of their iconic Obelisk of Light along front-line positions. It appears that the Obelisk's functionality has been improved with additional serial-channel capacitors. Although the basic architecture of the design does not deviate greatly from earlier generations, the core of the laser weapon has been enhanced for increased firing duration when the power output is reduced. Evidently the tower can now be set to sustained-fire mode when used against unarmored targets such as infantry and civilian vehicles. This allows the laser to fire at limited power in an arc, resulting in a cutting motion that can strike several infantry per emission. \n \n The advanced capacitor also allows over-charging of the tower by Nod's long-range artillery platform, the Beam Cannon. When one or more Beam Cannons focus their laser weapons at a receptor on the base of the tower it can fire over increased range by directly feeding the added energy into its mirror array. The limited targeting ability of the mirror array still suggests aircraft as the optimal answer for any Obelisks encountered on the field..."

Mission: Collect radiological and full spectrum data on Visitor structure Type 8 with intent to discern primary functional capability. Arrived 0200 hours undetected, 320 meters from target. Deployed receptors and gathered data for ~19 hours before "Seeker" patrol ambushed team. Six of eight team members eliminated in escape. One subsequently died of injuries sustained during extraction. \n \n - Initial analysis of gathered data shows that Type 8 structure acts as a "Gravity Stabilizer" to compensate for intense gravitic fields generated by planetary bodies. This evidently allows alien spacecraft to make short-range teleportation jumps into the Earth's magnetic and gravitic field with maximum precision. Gravity Stabilizers typically appear only in well secured areas where alien operations are highly focused. \n \n - Visitor craft observed utilizing the Gravity Stabilizer include the units designated as "Stormrider", "Planetary Assault Carrier", and "Devastator Warship". These craft appear to be entering the area of operations using the Gravity Stabilizer before heading to objectives in the surrounding regions. \n \n Recommendation: Prioritize destruction of Gravity Stabilizer structures in combat zones. In neutral zones disable via reactor sabotage in order to delay deployment of major enemy combat units. \n \n Note: Structure Type 8 now designated as Gravity Stabilizer. \n \n Connection Closed"

"The Philadelphia is gone, Reykjavik has been overrun, and Nod forces are now attacking the only remaining GDI world command hub in the Pentagon.  If we lose the Pentagon, GDI will be thrown into chaos and the war will be lost.  Your mission is to defend this vital installation.  The first priority is restoring power to the building defenses and systems so you can repel the main Nod attack.  Then you'll need to get an engineer into the Pentagon to reestablish the command and control system links.  Your final objective is to counter-attack and drive Nod out of the area."

Knocking out the disruption towers will open up options for GDI Central Command now that the Ion Cannons are nearly back online.  However, be aware that Kane and his Science Ministers have been working on a Liquid Tiberium device of considerable destructive power within Temple Prime.  It is imperative that you do not use the Ion Cannon on Temple Prime yourself without authorization.  An Ion Cannon strike could detonate the Liquid Tiberium in the Temple and set off a chain reaction in the large Tiberium fields found throughout this Yellow Zone - the resulting blast would be massively destructive and may kill millions.  This is a decision that will have to be made at the highest levels of the GDI command structure."
