- FS Downtown Breakdown:

  > Fixed the 2 Defensive Towers and a Civilian garrisonable structure having a "Tiberium Field Radius" around them


- FS Electromagnetic:
  
  > Added Snowy trees and bushes across the map

  > Edited the Reinforcement Bay scripts, the scripts to give units was not deactivating properly once the Bay was destroyed, only the timer disappeared, but the script kept running

  > Hopefully fixed the bug with "Achieving Victory" even if the game was a loss when a player leaves the game after their Command Center was destroyed (Even if the waves are still running, if a player left the game after their Command Center was destroyed, the game instantly ends in a victory)
  > When a player no longer has any structures left on the map (not defenses, only main buildings), their command center will now be destroyed
  > Added radar supplier to the AI (player 5) position
  > Fixed a bug where the enemy AI could die to support powers such as Shockwave Artillery, Orbital Ion Storm, and Air Dispersion Bomb
