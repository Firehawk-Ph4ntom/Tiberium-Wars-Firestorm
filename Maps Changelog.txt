  TW Firestorm V1.8 Maps Changelog

=========================================================================

=====================================
Skirmish Maps:

- Both FS Ghost Town and FS Mutant City:
  > Added cloud texture CM15_cloud and Macro texture TSCloudMed
  > Added some dust particle effects (YellowZoneAmbientFX_A), and more Tiberium Fauna around Tiberium Fields

- FS Ghost Town:
  > Edited all the player starting positions. (Mainly there was an issue with the bottom right player not being to deploy their MCV because it was too close to the tiberium field). However, all positions were edited to be more "centered" between their starting fields
  > Added additional ambient sound effects across the map
  > Fixed terrain height inconsistencies on player starting fields (Some player's starting fields appeared like they were in the ground)
  > All Tiberium Spikes now start at 50% health, and creep objects (excluding Mutant Hovel) start at 25%-50% health

- FS Mutant City:
  > Fixed bottom middle player's starting Tiberium Fields having less radius than the other starting Tiberium Fields
  > All Tiberium Spikes, Defensive Towers, and Expansion Points now start at 50% health, while creep objects (excluding Mutant Hovels) start at 25% health

- FS Snowy Tower Defense:
  > Fixed the Dummy structures for each player not being in their correct teams
  > Fixed the victory/loss condition scripts: "You have lost" during a defeat will not play twice anymore when losing, and "You are victorious" will no longer play during a loss anymore either
  > Fixed Kane's transmission being cut off when all players have been defeated
  > Objective markers will now hide 5 seconds after the objective was given
  > Players can no longer build on the road, this is to prevent complete blockade by walls or other objects that break the AI when trying to path through
  > Edited the lighting of the map, and added Cloud texture (CM5A_cloud)
  > Edited the scripts so that when a player dies it won't kill off the ambient map sound effects (esp player 2/3 when they die and the global wind sound effects would just suddenly stop playing)
  > Added some extra ambient sound effects across the map 
  > Removed Day/Night cycle scripts
  > Re-added Snow weather

- FS Cityside:
  > Replaced all Defensive Towers with Tiberium Spikes, and replaced the Spy Satellite with an EMP Center
  > Removed related scripts to Spy Satellite
