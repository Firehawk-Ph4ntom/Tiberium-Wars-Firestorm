  TW Firestorm V1.8 Maps Changelog

=========================================================================

=====================================
Skirmish Maps:

- All maps:
  > Edited the Tiberium Field radii, regeneration rate, and starting/maximum amount of crystals to spawn
  > Adjusted the lighting, atmosphere, and general feel of each map
  > Added extra ambient audio and random particle effects on every map (like dust/fog)
  > Adjusted water settings on maps with water and added skyboxes for every map

- [FS] Animosity:
  > Replaced the Heavy Research Facility with a Dropship Bay
  > Replaced the 2 contested Tiberium Spikes with Observation Posts

- [FS] Volcano Valley:
  > Added 4 Dropship Bays, 1 for each player

- [FS] Ghost Town:
  > Edited all the player starting positions. (Mainly there was an issue with the bottom right player not being to deploy their MCV because it was too close to the tiberium field). However, all positions were edited to be more "centered" between their starting fields
  > Fixed terrain height inconsistencies on player starting fields (Some player's starting fields appeared like they were in the ground)
  > All Tiberium Spikes now start at 50% health, and creep objects next to the EMP Control Center start at 25%-50% health (excluding Mutant Hovel and Dropship Bay)

- [FS] Electromagnetic:
  > Replaced the Reinforcment Bay with a Mutant Hovel, and replaced the player starting Mutant Hovels with Dropship Bays
  > Replaced the Expansion Points with Observation Posts

- [FS] Mutant City:
  > Fixed bottom middle player's starting Tiberium Fields having less radius than the other starting Tiberium Fields
  > All Tiberium Spikes and Dropship Bays (Replaced all Defensive Towers and Expansion Points with Dropship Bays) now start at 50% health, while creep objects (excluding Mutant Hovels) start at 25% health

- [FS] Snowy Tower Defense:
  > Fixed the Dummy structures for each player not being in their correct teams
  > Fixed the victory/loss condition scripts: "You have lost" during a defeat will not play twice anymore when losing, and "You are victorious" will no longer play during a loss anymore either
  > Fixed Kane's transmission being cut off when all players have been defeated
  > Objective markers will now hide 5 seconds after the objective was given
  > Players can no longer build on the road, this is to prevent complete blockade by walls or other objects that break the AI when trying to path through
  > Edited the scripts so that when a player dies it won't kill off the ambient map sound effects (esp player 2/3 when they die and the global wind sound effects would just suddenly stop playing)
  > Removed Day/Night cycle scripts
  > Edited all the waves (Added new units to the waves, adjusted the number of units that spawn with every wave, and cut down the number of waves from 24 to 20)
  > Added a Dropship Bay for each player

- [FS] Cityside:
  > Replaced all Defensive Towers with Neutral Observation Posts, and replaced the Spy Satellite with a Dropship Bay
