  TW Firestorm V1.8 Maps Changelog

=========================================================================

=====================================
Skirmish Maps:

- FS Ghost Town:
  > Edited all the player starting positions. (Mainly there was an issue with the bottom right player not being to deploy their MCV because it was too close to the tiberium field). However, all positions were edited to be more "centered" between their starting fields


- FS Snowy Tower Defense:
  > Fixed the Dummy structures for each player not being in their correct teams
  > Fixed the victory/loss condition scripts: "You have lost" during a defeat will not play twice anymore when losing, and "You are victorious" will no longer play during a loss anymore either
  > Fixed Kane's transmission being cut off when all players have been defeated
  > Objective markers will now hide 5 seconds after the objective was given
  > Players can no longer build on the road, this is to prevent complete blockade by walls or other objects that break the AI when trying to path through

- FS Devils Tongue and FS Volcano Valley:
  > All the volcano fire effects are now visible in the shroud

- FS Cityside:
  > Replaced all Defensive Towers with Tiberium Spikes, and replaced the Spy Satellite with an EMP Center
